The chemistry between manivannan and sathyaraj on screen should be seen to be believed, accompanied by astute dialogues this political had greater potential to be a landmark movie in the lines of it's predecessor Amaidhi Padai but the weak characterization of the support cast and an average script foiled a potential classic. Watch for the witty dialogues and the magnetism exuded by the \"Villain\" Sathyaraj!\n",
