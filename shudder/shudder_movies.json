Now it's up to Hyun-seo's father Gang-du, a food-stand worker who's anything but a traditional hero, to infiltrate the forbidden zone and rescue his daughter from the clutches of the horrifying creature.

Morton tells the story of eleven-year-old Lucy (newcomer Molly Windsor) seeking refuge as a ward of the state from her abusive father (Robert Carlyle). Placed in a tumultuous foster home, Lucy befriends her rebellious teenage roommate Lauren (Lauren Socha), and together they navigate the cold and uncaring world before them. With a screenplay by Tony Grisoni (FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS) based on original material by Samantha Morton, THE UNLOVED captures the subtle magic and melancholy of childhood while painting an honest portrait of a girl torn between a broken family and an inept social system.",

But the biggest shock comes at the end, which is actually the beginning of this savage story. Though the not-for-the-easily-triggered film bitterly divided audiences, it remains a must-see for fans of the Euro-shock era of the 2000’s.",

    "synopsis": "After a party where Tina watches a gruesome video on her friend’s phone, she begins to experience nasty nightmares. That would be bad enough, but then she begins to be haunted by a monster who nobody else can see. After her therapist suggests talking to the monster, Tina resists, then eventually relents. And that’s when things get even weirder. Is she losing her mind? Or is everyone else crazy? Or perhaps Tina’s trapped in a nightmare? German director Akiz’s first film in a planned trilogy offers no easy answers, but that’s part of the ferocious fun of this stylish and surreal Euro-horror head trip.",

    "synopsis": "In the climactic second part of the the Mesrine saga, Jacques Mesrine is back in France after his brazen assault on the maximum-security prison from which he daringly escaped. Once again in police custody and facing stern justice for his crimes, the 'man of a thousand faces' escapes directly from the courtroom after kidnapping the judge at gunpoint. As Mesrine continues to author his own legend through the media and his own memoirs, he becomes a household name and anti-hero across all of France.  As he plans his last and greatest escape, leaving France – and the iconic character he has created for himself - behind, the police begin to close in and his monumental rise begins to shadow the inevitable fall. The life of Jacques Mesrine comes once and for all to a full bloody circle in a climax only fitting for Public Enemy #1.",

    "synopsis": "After watching a scary S&M act at a club, Linda flies to Istanbul to see the Countess Nadine for work. But when she lands, Linda realizes Nadine (the legendary Soledad Miranda) is the same kinky vixen from the nightclub. As Linda falls under Nadine’s spell, she risks becoming a vampire herself - but, like, so what? Aided by a legendary psychedelic soundtrack, Jess Franco's biggest hit put a queer spin on classic vampire tropes, resulting in what Franco expert Stephen Thrower describes as a cross between a “sun-drenched erotic daydream and a humid sexual nightmare”.",

Robert’s big city temperament makes it impossible for him to fit in, or understand the uncivilized, bizarre behavior displayed by the townspeople. Quickly spiraling downward into an intense fable reminiscent of the Coen Brothers’ BLOOD SIMPLE and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN, TERRIBLY HAPPY displays a unique, often macabre vision of the darkest depths to which people will go to achieve a sense of security and belonging.",

The twisted Benno soon decides to test Tore’s faith in God in sadistic ways. Will Tore realize that his suffering is not part of God’s plan and fight back? Or will he keep turning the other cheek?

Lars takes in the brawny, mute Eddie after the latter’s caregiver passes away, but soon discovers that the façade of serenity hides something unimaginable: Eddie suffers from a rare form of sleepwalking that transforms him from a docile, cereal-obsessed art student into a ravenous sleepwalking cannibal. Initially horrified by Eddie’s dark secret, Lars becomes enthralled by the not-so-gentle giant: at long last, here’s the muse he’d been searching for! Exceptional art comes at a very high price...and how far is Lars willing to go for his next masterpiece?",

Though the actors are friends and in-laws and the sets are basements and garages, there’s an earnest devotion to truly unique storytelling that elevates The Soultangler beyond kitsch and into deeply unsettling territory. If H.P. Lovecraft rose from his grave in the late ’80s with a 16mm camera, ten severed heads, and a case of Schlitz, this would be the result.",

Fearing her boyfriend might be the one who’s been terrorizing her, Nicole flees with a new lover to a remote seaside house, but trouble soon follows. A Hitchcockian twist courtesy of the great giallo screenwriter Ernesto Gastaldi changes the film’s tone from sordid horror to stylish and witty whodunit in the vein of Agatha Christie.

Now It’s up to Lieutenant Williams, who knows plenty about vice, to catch the deadly Disney enthusiast. Of course, this being a Lucio Fulci film, every step closer results in dismemberment, disemboweling and death for another wanton woman. Set in the heydey of sleazy 1980s Times Square, which was rife with adult shops, theaters, and clubs, Fulci’s sickening slasher inspired an orgy of outrage and censorship. But, um, you’re over 18, right?",

Yes, he was a scumbag, and, as the film suggests, there was probably a correlation between his evil ways and the, um, “quality” of his most famous film. MST3K fan? Push play now.",

They call him the 'Tall Man' and for years children of a certain age have been disappearing from the poor mountain village where Julia (Jessica Biehl) lives. But when her child is taken, Julia decides to fight back. French director Pascal Laugier abandons the gore of his grisly debut MARTYRS, focusing instead on raw, nail biting suspense and terrifying twists you definitely won't see coming. Who is the Tall Man - and what does he really do with those kids?",

    "synopsis": "This surreal Japanese cult sensation profiles a man who mutates into metal being. Somewhere between a modern-day nightmare and a techno-fetishist's ultimate fantasy, this incredible film from Shinya Tsukamoto took viewers on a surreal journey into a dark and disturbing world where self-inflicted body transformations and post-human women form the fabric of a strange new reality. Likened to the work of David Lynch and David Cronenberg, TETSUO molds explosive violence, bizarre sexual imagery and jet-black humor into a cinematic experience unlike any you've seen. (In Japanese with English Subtitles)",

    "language": "English",
    "release_year": 2018,
    "synopsis": "Coming to Shudder in September and in theaters now. Debut director Coralie Fargeat announces her stunning arrival, painting a crimson canvas of hypnotic beauty and bloody retribution in this razor-sharp feminist subversion of the revenge-thriller. Jen (fearlessly embodied by Matilda Lutz, Rings) is enjoying a romantic getaway with her wealthy boyfriend which is suddenly disrupted when his sleazy friends arrive for an unannounced hunting trip. Tension mounts in the house until the situation abruptly––and viciously––intensifies, culminating in a shocking act that leaves Jen left for dead. Unfortunately for her assailants, Jen survives and reemerges with a relentless, wrathful intent: revenge.",

    "title": "Citadel",
    "language": "English",
    "release_year": 2012,
    "synopsis": "An agoraphobic man enlists a renegade priest to save his daughter from an evil gang of feral children who attacked his wife. Urged to pity the impoverished youngsters by a social worker, Tommy (the wonderful Aneurin Barnard) turns instead to the priest (James Cosmo of GAME OF THRONES) who believes the killer kiddies are demons who need to be exterminated. Roger Ebert hit the nail on the head when he called CITADEL, 'a horrifying thriller painted on a small and very dark canvas.' It's an intensely disturbing film sure to keep you from falling asleep tonight.",

    "title": "Castle Freak",
    "language": "English",
    "release_year": 1995,
    "synopsis": "An American family inherits an Italian castle which houses a bloodthirsty monster in Stuart Gordon's 1995 creature feature loosely based - of course - on an H.P. Lovecraft story. Gordon's favorite lead actor Jeffrey Combs (RE-ANIMATOR) stars as John, a man involved in an accident that claimed his son's life. Grieving and troubled, the family's unprepared for another blast of horror when the deformed beast starts prowling the halls. Gordon's underrated film is anchored by a dark, serious tone that's unlike his more tongue-in-cheek efforts, but still just as scary.",
