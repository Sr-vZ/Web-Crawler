    "synopsis": "A hauntingly atmospheric and star-studded adaptation of Henry James' classic gothic horror story. A young, inexperienced governess is hired to look after two small children abandoned by their uncle, following the death of their parents, at his grand country house. Unsettled by glimpses of ghostly figures that only she can see, she quickly believes that something malevolent is stalking the children in her care. She learns that her predecessor and her sinister lover both died under curious circumstances and prior to their death, they spent most of their time with Flora and Miles. Could they be the figures appearing to the new governess? But are appearances everything they seem to be? Are these apparitions truly supernatural or simply products of her overactive imagination? James' novel is brilliantly brought to life in this evocative drama - full of ambiguity, eeriness and menace.\n\n",

When Frank's controlling Aunt dies, the Westons expect him to propose to Emma - but his actions set in motion a chain of events that both shock Emma and make her realise something that has been in plain sight all along ...\n\n",

    "synopsis": "In a world where people panic about the rising global population, Japan is facing a very different future which could see their population shrink by a third in just 40 years. One reason is that the Japanese are not having enough babies and the causes of that form the basis of Anita Rani's intriguing journey. The film explores Otaku culture - the world of nerds and geeks obsessed with computer games and Manga cartoons - which has led to a withdrawal of many Japanese men from the whole dating game. Anita meets two men in their late thirties who have in depth relationships with virtual teenage girlfriends as part of a role playing game: 'I think twice about going out with a 3D woman', says one.\n\nThe Japanese have far less sex than other nations and Anita also meets the women who struggle to work and have children in a society still dominated by traditional gender roles. Added to this, Japan also has the oldest population in the world, 25% are over 65 and 50,000 over a hundred years old. Anita visits a group of pensioners cheerleaders and a prison with a wing especially designed for pensioners. Too few young people to pay tax, too many old people needing support - it has all led to a debt problem worse than that of Greece and an uncertain future for a country that still is the third largest economy in the world.\n\n",

Galen used first hand experience to describe his anatomical observations in writing so detailed that later Persian translations included illustrations. After the fall of Constantiople, classical works influenced Renaissance thinkers and artists like Leonardo da Vinci, who also performed dissections to discover how the human body works. Following Galen's evidence based investigation, Andreas Vesalius performed public dissections in Padua, noting in detailed illustrations and descriptions the human skeleton, muscles, nerves,organ and brain. His illustrations were classically posed before a landscape, showing a body in motion. Vesalius is known as the Founder of Modern Anatomy because of his \"De Humani Corporis Fabrica\" (The Fabric of the Human Body), that is as artful as it is accurate. A BBC Production.\n\n",

From the ideal to the real, the Romantic to the Surrealist, there have been almost no end of works devoted to the unclothed human body. This series - presented by writer and broadcaster Tim Marlow - will examine those artworks, the societies that produced them and the artists that made them.\n\nIn this episodeThe Nude -The Renaissance, marlow travels to england, France and Italy on a lively, visual journey illustrating how the Christain idea of nudity associated with sin was replaced with ideas of nudity being associated with beauty and sensuality. Included are Botticelli's 'Birth of Venus, Michelangelo's 'David' and Giotto's 'The Last Judgement'.\n\n",

    "title": "The Divine Michelangelo Part 1The Divine Michelangelo",
    "language": "",
    "release_year": 2004,
    "synopsis": "Michelangelo's path to success was plagued with difficulties. This programme traces the troubled origins of his genius, from boyhood beatings from his father, to fights with fellow artists. His father's feeling that his obsession with art would bring disgrace to the family failed to deter the young, determined Michelangelo. Inspiration to become a sculptor came early, when his father sent him to a wet-nurse whose husband was a stonemason. By the time he reached his teens he showed precocious talent and at the age of 25 he was a rising star.\n\nThe tempestuous young Michelangelo made a name for himself as an art faker and his first major commission was rejected by his patron. One night, gripped by rage and driven by a determination to ensure the world knew who he was, he carved his name across the breast of his first masterpiece, the Pieta. Then, aged 26, he took on the seemingly impossible challenge of sculpting a colossal statue of the biblical hero, David, from one piece of flawed marble. The towering nude, over five metres tall, took more than two years to complete but established Michelangelo as the greatest sculptor alive, immortalising him forever. The programme shows sculptor Romolo Burati as he re-creates key features of the David's face, conveying the sheer skill and craft embodied in Michelangelo's exquisite work. Having created this great masterpiece, Michelangelo's next challenge was to design a structure to transport the sculpture, which weighed several tons, across the uneven roads without the giant crashing to the ground.\n\nIt was no mean feat even by today's standards. To illustrate the technical skills that Michelangelo displayed, the programme enlists engineer Nick McLean to follow in Michelangelo's footsteps. Using illustrations and a diary entry from an eye witness, he develops a structure to shift the replica David through the cobbled Italian streets. It becomes clear that Michelangelo's commission to carve the David proved him to be not only a master sculptor, but also a thoroughly able engineer.\n\n",

    "title": "Cold Fear - Gay Life in Russia",
    "language": "",
    "release_year": 2014,
    "synopsis": "Cold Fear: Gay Life in Russia is a hauntingly beautiful and powerful documentary that travels to the dark heart of Russia and gives an insight into the reality of life - particularly gay life - that's in stark contrast to the glitz of the Sochi winter Olympics. There is fear on all sides, with many Russians equating gay behaviour with semi-demonic practices. They believe homosexuality is a lifestyle choice and see it as a direct attack on family values, even as a poison that is corrupting society and weakening Russia. On the other side, many gay Russians live in fear of direct intimidation, persecution and violence - and even murder. This film gives ordinary Russians a voice as it exposes a world of widespread repression and extreme violence: a world of cold fear.\n\nCold Fear: Gay Life in Russia is a searingly honest BBC current affairs and politics documentary which takes a look at what it is like to be gay in Russia, and explores the fears and intimidation that gay people have to live with on a daily basis.\n\n",

    "title": "King Lear - with Christopher PlummerShakespeare Uncovered",
    "language": "",
    "release_year": 2014,
    "synopsis": "King Lear is universally acknowledged as one of Shakespeare's greatest tragic roles. Plummer has played the role under the direction of Sir Jonathan Miller (who, we discover, has directed it six times).\n\nLear was, in fact, a real English king, who lived 800 years before Christ. Shakespeare's premise of Lear dividing his kingdom among his daughters and, in the process, disinheriting his favorite is, for the most part, supposedly true. It is included in the Chronicles of English History, which Shakespeare often used as source material. The historic story has a happy ending, but Shakespeare gave his theatrical interpretation a dreadful denouement that has been shocking audiences for 400 years.\n\nIan McKellen and Simon Russell Beale share their insights into this often-difficult character. And Plummer examines what inspired Shakespeare to write a play about a kingdom divided - at a delicate moment when a new King (James) from Scotland was trying to create what has become the \"united kingdom.\"\n\nWe learn how the storm scenes might have been produced at Shakespeare's own theater, and how they represent the storm going on in Lear's mind. The pain he endures is so intense that Shakespeare's version of the story was soon rewritten with a happy ending; at the Globe, we see this alternate ending acted out. Then we return to the real play and its heart-breaking tragedy of old age. One of Shakespeare's later plays, its ending may reflect something of his own mature cynicism. The powers of good fail and the gods do not prevent the deaths of Lear and Cordelia. But Plummer finds that beneath the cosmic emptiness, the possibility of love survives.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Over 80 years after her death, Marie Curie remains by far the best known female scientist. In her lifetime, she became that rare thing: a celebrity scientist, attracting the attention of the news cameras and tabloid gossip. They were fascinated because she was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize and is still the only person to have won two Nobels in two different sciences. But while the bare bones of her scientific life, the obstacles she had to overcome, the years of painstaking research, and the penalty she ultimately paid for her discovery of radium have become one of the iconic stories of scientific heroism, there is another side to Marie Curie: her human story.\n\nThis multi-layered film reveals the real Marie Curie, an extraordinary woman who fell in love three times, had to survive the pain of loss, and the public humiliation of a doomed love affair. It is a riveting portrait of a tenacious mother and scientist, who opened the door on a whole new realm of physics, which she discovered and named: radioactivity.\n\n",

Filmed in the Fens and Winchester, Gloucester, Oxford and Rome, the key figure in this episode is Alfred's daughter Aethelflaed, the ruler of Mercia. Michael Wood recovers her story from a copy of a lost chronicle written in Mercia in her lifetime which, in the film, we hear read in Old English.\n\nOne of the great forgotten figures in British history, Aethelflaed led armies, built fortresses, campaigned against the Vikings and was a brilliant diplomat. Her fame spread across the British Isles, beloved by her warriors and her people she was known simply as 'the Lady of the Mercians'. Without her, concludes Wood, 'England might never have happened'.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Founded in 1850, Lehman Brothers was one of Wall Street's oldest investment banks, but in September 2008, having taken a heavy blow from the sub prime mortgage crisis enveloping the US, it was on the brink of collapse. This film joins the story on Friday 12 September as the CEOs of Wall Street's leading investment houses and commercial banks are briefed on the Lehman situation. The US Treasury will not intervene - the only hope of controlling the chaos that would ensue if Lehman collapsed lies with the banks themselves. But all those present know that, due to the interconnected nature of 21st century banking, chaos for one financial institution means chaos for all... Inspired by the events of those three days, this drama follows the major players as they race against the clock to put together a rescue package for the failing bank and shows how they all have something to gain or lose during the long weekend's negotiation. The Last Days of Lehman Brothers tells the story of the most dramatic weekend on Wall Street since 1929 and a moment in time that will live on in history.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Astonishingly, David Harewood was the first black actor to play the great Moorish Venetian general Othello at London's National Theatre, triumphantly taking on the role--but not until 1997. Now he returns to the play to discover how the centuries have changed our views of it.\n\nHarewood learns about the Moorish ambassador who visited the court of Queen Elizabeth I and may have inspired Shakespeare. He meets the National Theatre's latest Othello, Adrian Lester, who has also starred in a play about Ira Aldridge, the 19th-century American actor who was the first black man ever to play the role in England; the reviews were shockingly racist. And he watches different Othellos on film, including Laurence Olivier's acclaimed if controversial \"blacked-up\" version from the 1960s.\n\nOthello is actually a play dominated not by race, but by love and a great villain - Iago. A forensic psychiatrist helps to analyze this extraordinary psychopath and how he manipulates Othello by persuading him that his young wife is having an affair. Harewood meets Simon Russell Beale, who played Iago to his Othello, and they re-examine the lethal relationship. Imogen Stubbs and Sir Ian McKellen, who starred in Trevor Nunn's production; Julia Stiles, whose movie O was a modern take on the play; and Sir Patrick Stewart, who played Othello in a \"color-reversed\" production, also reflect on their characters.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "In the 1970s Roberta Flack became a global sensation with hits such as The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, Feel Like Making Love and Killing Me Softly. Her style of soulful pop transcended the US East Coast jazz clubs to become the dinner party sound track for Middle America. But behind this seemingly effortless career rise lies a much deeper, more substantial journey. Born into humble circumstances in America's segregated South, Roberta was a self-created musical prodigy who was one of the first and most significant black artists to cross over into the mainstream. This film follows Roberta's journey from her childhood in Arlington, Virginia in the 1930s and 40s, to the jazz clubs of Washington D.C. where Roberta honed her style, to the moment she signed up with Atlantic Records and became a multi-Grammy Award-winning star. It is a deeply personal story told alongside the wider context of America's civil rights movement, a struggle that was to strike a chord all over the world.\n\n",

For at least 30,000 years, humans have represented the naked form in a variety of ways. From the ideal to the real, the Romantic to the Surrealist, there have been almost no end of works devoted to the unclothed human body. This series - presented by writer and broadcaster Tim Marlow - will examine those artworks, the societies that produced them and the artists that made them.\n\nIn this episode, The Nude -The Modern, Marlow explores examples of the nude in the Modern period: Manet's 'Olympia', Picasso's 'Les Demoiselles D'Avignon' and Bacon's 'Triptych'. Marlow explains how the 20th century changed perspective on the nude in art as emotional truth overcame physical realism. With the advent of photography and film, nothing seemed beyond the artists' interest or capabilities.\n\n",

    "language": "",

    "synopsis": "The story of Michelangelo's titanic struggle to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, one of the artistic marvels of the world. Imagine the torture of painting an area the size of a football pitch, 20 metres off the ground. From 1508 to 1512, this is exactly what Michelangelo was forced to do by Pope Julius II, who commissioned him to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Michelangelo viewed it as a trap set by his enemies in the Vatican and was horrified that he would have to stoop to what he considered the lowly and inferior craft of painting. What he really wanted to do was carve the Pope's tomb - a saga in itself, which would haunt him for years to come. As Michelangelo confronted the huge expanse of the ceiling, he quickly ran into huge difficulties and ended up destroying his own work.\n\nThis programme explores some of the main challenges he faced by recruiting two modern fresco artists - Fleur Kelly and Leo Stevenson - to produce at a church in Leyton, east London, their own version of the iconic scene where God creates Adam. After four years of struggle and disappointment, the Sistine Chapel ceiling was complete. But the Pope was dissatisfied with the heavenly creation and demanded changes, such as the addition of more gold and blue, as he felt it looked too poor. Michelangelo, made ill by his trials, was not amused. But 25 years later, he did return to the Sistine Chapel to paint the fresco of The Last Judgement on the altar wall. Having established his genius as a sculptor and painter, Michelangelo went on to completely change the Roman skyline with his architectural designs. He broke many of the accepted rules of architecture, creating terrifically original and beautiful work, culminating in the dome of St Peter's.\n\nHe was obsessed by this final project for the rest of his life. He saw it as a deeply spiritual task that would assure him a place in history and in heaven. In his later years, Michelangelo's poetry also blossomed. Struck by true love for a young Roman nobleman named Cavalieri, he was inspired to write some of his most moving verses. When Michelangelo died at the age of 88 he left a fortune, including 8,000 gold coins in a walnut chest by his bed and numerous farms in Tuscany. He lived a simple, frugal existence but was also the richest, and most famous, artist ever to have lived.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Fiennes has a unique perspective on Romeo and Juliet. He played Shakespeare - both writing and performing as Romeo - in the film Shakespeare in Love. Now he wants to examine why it remains the most-performed of all Shakespeare plays.\n\nFiennes takes us back to the source - an Italian story translated into English when Shakespeare was a boy. Shakespeare adapted and dramatized the Italian poem, and other writers have been adapting him for centuries ever since. At London's Royal Ballet, viewers see the play in a famous dance interpretation, and later Stephen Sondheim discusses adapting for the Broadway musical theater as West Side Story. Fiennes visits adult night classes at a South London school where the participants can see their own lives reflected in the play.\n\nOrlando Bloom and Condola Rashad, who recently played the immortal lovers on Broadway in 2013, discuss the continuing power of the play and its poetry. And Fiennes looks at noted film adaptations, ranging from Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 Italian masterpiece to Baz Luhrman's contemporary re-imagining. We attend the premiere of a new film adaptation, this time rewritten by Julian Fellowes. Back at the Globe, we watch as the company rehearses a scene with a young man very effectively playing Juliet - just as would have been done in Shakespeare's time.\n\nThe ending of this play is so tragic that for years rewritten versions dominated the stage. Yet Fiennes sees a more hopeful message coming from the tragic ending, one about the eternal power of love.\n\n",

Over the course of the film, Robb attempts to reconnect with his extremist step-brother, to discover what's made the person he'd looked up to as a teenage role model so strongly reject all that his family and the Western world stand for.\n\n",

Exploring its devastating impact on lives, careers and relationships, Charlie Elmore highlights how society treats young adults who are dealing with its wide-ranging and not always obvious symptoms. The winter sports instructor was injured in a snowboarding accident and, after being helicoptered to hospital and placed in an induced coma, spent months in rehabilitation. She made an amazing recovery - even getting back on a snowboard a year later - but she's still coming to terms with how her brain has changed and knows that not everyone is lucky enough to get the right treatment. This compelling documentary follows Charlie as she retraces the steps of her rehabilitation and meets three other young people recovering from recent brain injuries. Together, they embark on a mission to improve our understanding, prevention and treatment of this life-changing disability.\n\n",

This series - presented by writer and broadcaster Tim Marlow - will examine those artworks, the societies that produced them and the artists that made them.\n\nIn this episode, The Nude -The Classical, Tim Marlow's main focus is the ancient classical world.

But there's also a dark side, with later legends that the king had his brother drowned at sea. In his last desperate struggle, Aethelstan defeated a huge invasion of Vikings and Scots in what became known as the Anglo-Saxon 'Great War'.\n\nWood argues that Aethelstan was one of the greatest English monarchs, and with his grandfather Alfred, his father Edward and his aunt Aethelflaed, a member of our most remarkable royal family and 'even more than the Tudors, the most gifted and influential rulers in British history'.\n\n",

Although we don't realise it, the way we see everything in the world today is through the eyes of the computers.\n\nThis is the story of the dream that rose up in the 1990s that computers could create a new kind of stable world. They would bring about a new kind global capitalism free of all risk and without the boom and bust of the past. They would also abolish political power and create a new kind of democracy through the internet where millions of individuals would be connected as nodes in cybernetic systems - without hierarchy.\n\nThe film tells the story of two perfect worlds. One is the small group of disciples around the novelist Ayn Rand in the 1950s. They saw themselves as a prototype for a future society where everyone could follow their own selfish desires. The other is the global utopia that digital entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley set out to create in the 1990s. Many of them were also disciples of Ayn Rand. They believed that the new computer networks would allow the creation of a society where everyone could follow their own desires, yet there would not be anarchy. They were joined by Alan Greenspan who had also been a disciple of Ayn Rand. He became convinced that the computers were creating a new kind of stable capitalism - \"Like a New Planet\", he said.\n\nBut the dream of stability in both worlds would be torn apart by the two dynamic human forces - love and power.\n\n",

As anatomists used dissections to discover the truth about the human body, illustrators worked with them to create anatomically accurate drawings to be used as a teaching tool for medical students and surgeons. Anatomical art also found its way into galleries visited by art patrons in Rembrandt's Amsterdam. We follow the demand for first hand experience from Galen and Vesalius as anatomists leave behind the classical ideal and seek more accurate depictions of what they saw.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "A series of films exploring the idea that we have been colonised by the machines we have built. Although we don't realise it, the way we see everything in the world today is through the eyes of the computers.\n\nThis is the story of how our modern scientific idea of nature, the self-regulating ecosystem, is actually a machine fantasy. It has little to do with the real complexity of nature. It is based on cybernetic ideas that were projected on to nature in the 1950s by ambitious scientists. A static machine theory of order that sees humans, and everything else on the planet, as components - cogs - in a system.\n\nBut in an age disillusioned with politics, the self-regulating ecosystem has become the model for utopian ideas of human 'self-organizing networks' - dreams of new ways of organising societies without leaders, as in the Facebook and Twitter revolutions, and in global visions of connectivity like the Gaia theory.\n\nThis powerful idea emerged out of the hippie communes in America in the 1960s, and from counterculture computer scientists who believed that global webs of computers could liberate the world.\n\nBut, at the very moment this was happening, the science of ecology discovered that the theory of the self-regulating ecosystem wasn't true. Instead they found that nature was really dynamic and constantly changing in unpredictable ways. But the dream of the self-organizing network had by now captured our imaginations - because it offered an alternative to the dangerous and discredited ideas of politics.\n\n",

Doctors at Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital can operate but the surgery carries a high risk of paralysis. At the hospital's Obstetrics Department, a pregnant mother faces a comparable issue. Her unborn baby has serious spinabifida - and now an ultrasound scan shows what might be a tumour on his back. She must decide whether to continue with the pregnancy.\n\nPatients like these often become 'frequent-flyer' cases for brain surgeons like Jay Jayamohan. 'You know when you take these kids on they're going to be with you for your entire life', says Jay. We meet 19-year-old Jack, who Jay has been treating for eight years. Jack was born with Crouzon syndrome, a serious genetic abnormality which affects every cell in his body. He has had, so far, 27 operations. We meet him during yet another hospital stay - this time for 11 weeks - as Jay and his colleagues battle to control a leak of cerebral fluid from the back of Jack's head.\n\nIn this series, we see the dramatic and cutting edge brain surgery performed by Jay and his colleagues in Oxford and we see the personal cost to the patients and doctors who have to make often agonising decisions.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Bonneville started his career at the Open Air Theatre in Regent's Park, understudying Ralph Fiennes as Lysander, one of the four lovers in A Midsummer Night's Dream. He and Fiennes meet up again to try to untangle the extraordinary plot of one of Shakespeare's most enduringly popular plays, a great comedy of love and enchantment.\n\nBonneville goes to see the play - on Midsummer's Night - at the Globe Theatre and talks to the Globe's Artistic Director Dominic Dromgoole about its delicate balance between comedy and tragedy, the natural and the supernatural. It is thought the play might have been performed as part of a wedding celebration, and the Globe actors try some of the scenes in the stately ruins of Copped Hall right next to the site of the original structure which may have been the play's original performance venue.\n\nAt one point of the Dream, Shakespeare has fun with his own great romantic tragedy. The play's final scene, in which Bottom and his fellow mechanicals perform a dreadfully bad version of a Romeo & Juliet-like story, is one of the best-loved scenes in all of Shakespeare. Hugh meets up with actor David Walliams, who is about to play Bottom, and looks back on James Cagney's performance in the 1935 film.\n\nWe see clips from the landmark Peter Brook production and the BBC's 1980 production with Helen Mirren as Titania, and hear from director Julie Taymor, who recently staged a vivid production at the Theater for a New Audience in Brooklyn (starring David Harewood). In the deserted Globe Theatre, Bonneville muses on the play's enduring appeal.\n\n",

Did Darwin Kill God? is a thought-provoking programme where Anglican Christian, philosopher and theologian Conor Cunningham explains why these two beliefs are not in conflict.\n\nRichard Dawkins, famous for his book The God Delusion, believes there is an irreconcilable clash between the theory of evolution and a belief in God. But Conor thinks Dawkins is mistaken. He uncovers traditional Christian thinking about the creation of life, reveals how Christians were never expected to read the creation account in Genesis literally and discovers that Creationism is a modern invention.\n\nCommunicating his passion for the subject with rich visual metaphors in Did Darwin Kill God? and making complex ideas accessible, Conor shows how Darwin's vision of the universe enhances our appreciation of a natural world that is full of wonder and stunning intelligibility - a vision of existence which neither leads to nor precludes either atheism or faith.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "In programme one of this two-part series, Jacques Peretti looks at how the super-rich first exploited an obscure legal loophole to make Britain one of the most attractive tax havens on earth. He argues this was no accident. Wooing the super-rich was a deliberate strategy by government to reconfigure the British economy, under the belief their wealth would trickle down to the rest of us. But it didn't. The OECD now say the British economy would have been 20 per cent bigger had we not pursued the super-rich. So who sold us the fallacy and why?\n\nJacques meets the super-rich themselves - from those buying premiership football clubs to the billionaires who are breaking ranks to criticise the decisions that made them richer and society more unequal.\n\nJacques challenges the architects of these policies, as well as tracking down the foreign multimillionaires who are buying up Britain and turning us from a nation of property owners to a nation of renters.\n\nHe uncovers new research that shows growing inequality has been driven by this key factor of unaffordable property, and the far-reaching effect this will have on every aspect of our lives. Inequality is reshaping Britain into two simple classes: the 99 per cent and the one per cent. This is the story of how it happened and what it means for all of us.\n\n",

But scandal and corruption in the 18th century had led to a curtailment of its powers by the British government. The state now controlled the company's affairs in India and, throughout the 19th century, would chip away at its remaining powers and trading privileges.\n\nThe company was transformed from a trading enterprise into the rulers of India, and governed vast swathes of the subcontinent on behalf of the British Crown. Its territory expanded enormously and an empire was born.\n\nAs the company traded opium to a reluctant Chinese Empire, in India a dangerous chasm opened up between the British rulers and the Indian people. Alienated and disaffected, significant numbers of the company's massive army of Indian soldiers finally revolted and the Company's handling of the mutiny was its final undoing. In 1858 British India passed into Queen Victoria's hands and the Raj was born.\n\n",

But what if you couldn't remember anything after just a few hours, often forgetting to take off your clothes before getting in the bath, or couldn't even recognise your own reflection? And how much tougher is it if you're just a teenager? We normally associate memory loss with older people, but around the UK scores of teenagers are battling with severe amnesia. This film follows a number of young amnesiacs in their day-to-day lives and for the first time, reveals the huge challenges they face; from school and sports, to shopping and relationships, showing how things most people take for granted are a heartbreaking struggle for these young people.\n\n",

Elsewhere, on a visit to the spectacularly opulent Harewood House in Yorkshire, he glimpses how the slave owners' wealth seeped into every corner of Britain.\n\nFinally, amongst the vast slave registers that record all 800,000 men, women and children in British hands at the point of abolition, David counts the tragic human cost of this chapter in history.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "A series of films exploring the idea that we have been colonised by the machines that we have built, seeing everything in the world today through the eyes of computers.\n\nThis episode looks at why we humans find this machine vision so beguiling. The film argues it is because all political dreams of changing the world for the better seem to have failed - so we have retreated into machine-fantasies that say we have no control over our actions because they excuse our failure.\n\nAt the heart of the film is one of the most famous scientists in the world - Bill Hamilton. He argued that human behaviour is really guided by codes buried deep within us. It was later popularised by Richard Dawkins as 'the selfish gene'. It said that individual human beings are really just machines whose only job is to make sure the codes are passed on for eternity.\n\nThe film begins in 2000 in the jungles of the Congo and Rwanda. Hamilton is there to help prove his dark theories. But all around him the Congo is being torn apart by 'Africa's First World War'. The film then interweaves the two stories - the strange roots of Hamilton's theories, and the history of the West's tortured relationship with the Congo over the past 100 years.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Cattrall has played Cleopatra twice. Now she explores the real character of the great Queen of Egypt, and travels to Rome, ironically Marc Antony's city, in her quest to find out more about the historical Cleopatra. She also meets with her director, Dame Janet Suzman, who herself made an iconic Cleopatra at the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1973. Together they begin to uncover the truth behind this astonishing middle-aged love story. Antony and Cleopatra are no lovesick juveniles; they are mature, heroic - real - political figures. As such they were quite dangerous roles to write, let alone to play.\n\nCattrall watches different Cleopatras, meets Harriet Walter and Vanessa Redgrave (who have also played the role) and joins actors rehearsing the play at the Globe. Cleopatra is one of the greatest and largest of all Shakespeare's female roles, and must have required a boy actor of extraordinary skill. We look at the source Shakespeare used and how closely he copied the language of a Roman historian to describe Cleopatra's beauty; today he might be at risk for plagiarism. But comparing one of the most famous speeches in the play with its source, line by line, reveals the power of Shakespeare's poetry.\n\nThe episode tracks Marc Antony's first appearance in Shakespeare, as a young and powerful figure in Julius Caesar. Richard Johnson and Patrick Stewart discuss playing Cleopatra's now-aging lover in the later play.\n\nThe conflict between the public and private lives of these two historic figures was bound to end in tragedy. They fail to defeat or escape their enemies. As in Romeo and Juliet, both die by their own hands. In the Globe's candlelit indoor theatre - a version of the playhouse where this play was once performed - Cattrall watches the actors play out Cleopatra's last moments.\n\n",

After Charles II's brother, the Catholic James VII and II, was deposed by protestant William of Orange in 1688, Britain became a constitutional monarchy.\n\nHowever, the so-called 1688 'Glorious Revolution' came at a price, as Scotland lost her sovereignty and became part of Great Britain in 1707, whilst Ireland had been reduced from a kingdom to a colony. The politics of resentment has continued to trouble Ireland until the present day.\n\n",

For at least 30,000 years, humans have represented the naked form in a variety of ways. From the ideal to the real, the Romantic to the Surrealist, there have been almost no end of works devoted to the unclothed human body. This series - presented by writer and broadcaster Tim Marlow - will examine those artworks, the societies that produced them and the artists that made them.\n\nIn this episode, The Nude - The Enlightenment, Tim Marlow looks at how the image of a naked bosy was used for a variety of purposes during the period - to shock, to coerce, to titillate, to impress and to instruct. Examples are Rembrandt's 'The Anatomy Lesson', Ingres' 'The Turkish Bath' and Rodin's 'The Age of Bronze'.\n\n",

With a booming economy and massive social changes, there is a swagger to this once-sleeping giant, but what do we know of it apart from football and carnival? Michael Palin has travelled across most of the globe over the years, but never to Brazil. In this four-part series he crosses the country as big as a continent to find out what makes it tick.\n\nHe begins his journey in the north east, where modern Brazil was born. It was here the Portuguese explorers first landed and encountered the native Brazilians. It was here that hundreds of thousands of African slaves were brought to work on sugar and tobacco plantations, and it was here where this mix of races and cultures produced what we now think of as Brazil. Music, food, dance, religion - all of these bear the imprint of this heady mix.\n\nHe starts in the city of Sao Luis during the celebration of its own very north eastern festival of Bumba Meu Boi - 'Jump My Bull' - before travelling down the coast to Recife and Salvador. On his way, he drops in on the vaqueros - Brazilian cowboys - who work the massive cattle ranches of the dry interior. His travels also take him to the stunning coastal lagoons of the Lencois Maranheses national park.\n\nIn Salvador he learns to drum with the famous Olodum school, experiences the trance and dance of Candomble, the Afro-Brazilian religion, finds out how to cook Bahian-style with renowned cook, Dada, and discovers what lies behind the beguiling moves of capoeria dancers. If you want to know what makes Brazil so vibrant, the north east is the place to start.\n\n",

Ryanair's Michael O'Leary and EasyJet's Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou opened up new frontiers in the aviation industry as their airlines offered cheap flights to a vast range of popular and alternative destinations. This programme follows O'Leary as he flies to Poland, takes an EasyJet flight to Moscow and joins a group of lads travelling to Riga to sample the low-cost airline experience. As the cost of flying keeps increasing, how much further can these companies grow? Stelios, EasyJet's biggest shareholder, is trying to halt its expansion, while O'Leary has just placed a massive order for new planes. This documentary tells the incredible true story of how low cost flight was born, shining a light on the main players' history, their ethos, their business strategy and their outlandish publicity stunts.\n\n",

The United Nations estimates almost 200,000 people have been killed since Syria's civil war began, with many hundreds of thousands more injured. Millions have been forced from their homes, but the full human cost of the conflict is little known to the outside world because of the danger Western journalists face in trying to enter areas not controlled by the government. Most doctors have fled from those locations and many hospitals have been destroyed. The documentary follows British trauma surgeon David Nott as he makes the perilous journey across the border into Syria to work alongside medics who have stayed behind and shows him carrying out life-saving surgery in a facility forced underground by daily bombardment.\n\n",

    "release_year": 2014,
    "synopsis": "Freeman first discovered Shakespeare in school in Mississippi. He went on to play the hero of this play - Petruchio - in The Public Theater's Shakespeare in the Park production in New York, set in the Wild West. Freeman notes this play has set the template for all of the battle-of-the-sexes comedies that have followed; many a romantic comedy has The Taming of the Shrew running through its veins.\n\nIt's a love story between two unlikely characters. The Shrew is Katherine, a woman who is bitter, viperish, wild - or simply not prepared to accept the conventions of her time - and thus \"unmarriageable.\" Petruchio is after a wife, and the wealthier the better. We see some Petruchios who took on the \"taming\" - including Richard Burton, John Cleese and Raul Julia - and such famous Kates as Elizabeth Taylor, Fiona Shaw, Sinead Cusack and Meryl Streep. Freeman reunites with his own Kate, Tracey Ullman. Julia Stiles, star of the 1999 teen comedy adaptation, 10 Things I Hate About You, reflects on this contemporary version. And the Royal Shakespeare Company takes a version of the play to a school near where Shakespeare grew up, where viewers observe what children make of this very adult piece.\n\nFor many, this play is uncomfortable to watch. It was one of Shakespeare's very first plays and may seem too brutal for modern audiences. It ends with a speech about how women should obey their men. But is this the sexist propaganda that it first appears - or is there something more complicated (and interesting) going on? Freeman concludes that beneath the apparent cruelty is a message about equality in relationships. And we hear observations from many women who also admire the play, including pioneering feminist Germaine Greer (who appears as an expert commentator in several episodes).\n\n",

We hear their hopes, their dreams and their ideas on what would make their world a better place.\n\nIn 2000, 180 world leaders agreed on a series of ambitious targets to improve the lives of people everywhere. The Millennium Development Goals they signed up to were meant to herald unprecedented progress in every corner of Earth. They promised enormous reductions in poverty, increased life expectancy and an altogether fairer world.\n\nThose goals are being renewed this year.

Their pain and despair is all too clear when they have to separate parents from a sick child and then when that child loses their fight for life. But even in these desperately difficult circumstances there are moments of euphoria as patients who have been cured leave the centre. Exclusive footage also reveals the medical staff's frustrations at the lack of support from the international community and pharmaceutical companies in fighting the Ebola virus, which has been responsible for more than 5,000 deaths since the outbreak began.\n\n",

Their careers were made up of bloody battles and tactical bribery, stunning innovation and profound corruption, dazzling rhetoric and vicious back-stabbing - and together they form a picture of the most sophisticated highs and most brutal lows of the Roman Empire's inception, heyday and decline. Stretching at its peak, from the north of England to southern Egypt and from the west coast of Spain to Syria in the east, the Roman Empire included within its boundaries myriad people, cultures and climates. The task of ruling it seems an impossible one, even with today's communication technology. So how was it achieved two thousand years ago? And why has ancient Rome had such profound influence on western civilization ever since?\n\nWhether your interest is Caesar's brilliant military manoeuvring, Rome's astonishing statuary and architecture or the political strategies behind imperial power, these films offer an accessible introduction to the subject. \"An elegantly made and intelligently composed programme\" - Daily Telegraph Using unequalled location footage, previously unseen images and careful re-enactments, and the expertise of the world's finest scholars, this series brings to life the world of ancient Rome.

The stories unfold through observational sequences and interviews with the main players at critical points in the drama.\n\nWhat motivates the real estate agents in matching buyers and sellers?

For them, there's more than bricks and mortar at stake--it's their dreams, their memories and the single biggest investment of their lives.\n\nUnder the Hammer is there with them at the dinner table, at the open house, at the meeting with the agent and of course just prior to, during, and after the auction.\n\nThis is a series which captures not only intimate emotional moments but the displays of bravado, happiness, shock and disappointment as the hammer goes down.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Melbourne is home to a fascinating, eccentric, erudite and warring tribe of men. They are pious and bawdy, gregarious and solitary, indulgent and ascetic, radical and conservative, young and old. They are the men of the Blessed Sacrament Order at the St Francis Monastery in the heart of Melbourne. Their lives are turned upside down when they are forced to move to a pub during renovations.\n\nMany of the fathers and brothers are facing old age. They can no longer climb the stairs and it is hoped that new en-suite bathrooms will ease the problem. While most of the men relocate to the pub across the road, Father Ken Boland decides to stay on-site in a workers shed. Others seek alternative accommodation: historian Father Donald Cave moves to his old house in inner-city Melbourne, Father Gonzalo Munoz takes a job as live-in caretaker of a meditation centre, and Brother Gerard Develin must part with his pet budgie for the period of construction.\n\nThe renovation acts as a catalyst, prompting the men to question their faith and commitment to the Catholic church. A number are even unsure whether they will return to the monastery once refurbishment is complete.\n\nThroughout the upheaval, church life goes on. Mass is still said and confessions are heard. A young member of the order, Brother Boris Perlaki, is ordained and a funeral is held for Brother Bernard Scanlan, who dies on his 102nd birthday.\n\nThe series follows Father Donald to Rome where he delivers his latest book on the order's founder, and to Istanbul where he fulfils his life-long dream to visit Aya Sofya, once one of the greatest churches in Christendom. Back in Melbourne, Brother Gerard makes regular trips to the outskirts of the city to visit his budgie, now boarding with a friend.\n\nOnce Were Monks is the story of what happens when this tight-knit community is thrown into the outside world. It is about the problems of faith in the modern era, the forces of change and the pressures of tradition. Ultimately it is about a group of men who share in religious life with all its joys and sorrows.\n\n",

This four-part series takes an eye-opening journey behind the scenes of Australia's multi-billion dollar tourism industry.\n\nSelling Australia reveals a world of ruthless marketing where canny entrepreneurs are determined to give visitors exactly what they want, whether it's a taste of Aboriginal culture, sandy beaches or a bush adventure. It's the Australia they've come to expect overseas and a picture that has been carefully and expensively constructed through international advertising campaigns and local initiatives. But how does it fit with reality and the image the nation has of itself? And is it evolving as the country changes?\n\nThis entertaining, often amusing series offers a ride around the Golden Triangle of Australian tourism, from Sydney at the height of its Olympic frenzy to the Reef in tropical Queensland, and then to the country's red heart. It moves at a cracking pace from shearing sheds and indigenous dancing to snorkelling and Japanese weddings, with plenty of photo opportunities on the way. As expected, the scenery is stunning and experiences memorable. But at the centre of each episode are important questions about Australia and the nation's identity.\n\nWith tourism fast becoming one of the biggest industries across the globe, Selling Australia looks at just how far a country is prepared to go in search of the tourist dollar.\n\n",

These are familiar scenes of bills, endless washing, weekend sports, the frenetic noise of games, the strange quiet of sleep.\n\nDave leaves for work at six in the morning, before the rest of the family is awake. Sally is a full-time, hands-on mum, who assists in her children's classrooms. \"I thought you had kids and whilst they played, you read books and got your photos in order,\" she laughs.\n\nSally is the patient one, the disciplinarian. Dave, in many ways, is a big kid himself - joining the afternoon backyard footy games with glee. He admits he's made some selfish decisions in the past. Despite the family's reluctance to move from Newcastle, Dave accepted a job in Sydney from which he was later made redundant. He's now got a new, more junior position which will help meet the mortgage payments on their Concord home.\n\nIt's hard sometimes for Dave and Sally to balance their different attitudes and approaches, and even harder to find time for themselves among the constant whirlwind of children and activities. But as we listen to these two often-exhausted parents talk about their young family, their postponed renovations, their frustrations and dreams, we see how communication, respect and humour are really the essence of successful family life.\n\n",

She met her Greek husband when she was 23 and had two children before she discovered from police that he was a bigamist. Although she divorced him, her daughters Julie and Simone say the family has never said a bad word about their father, who has since died.\n\nThe girls have a clutch of loving relatives and another inspiring role model in Helen's gutsy mum, who brought up seven children almost single-handedly and is still helping them out.\n\nBut this is not a stereotypical Lebanese-Greek household. Helen has supported the family by working most nights in a pub. She has always been open with her girls, giving them freedom and encouraging them to make the most of their education and opportunities. At 17 and 22, Julie and Simone are strong, beautiful and intelligent. Opinionated and lively, these three women are always talking - about work, money, music, boys - and they love a party.\n\nNow, the family is at a turning point.

Millions died in the Vietnam War and 400,000 of them have never been found. But some families of the missing have found new hope in the form of a group of psychics. Accepted, if not approved of, by the government, these psychics believe they can talk to the dead. In 1996, they set up a centre devoted to the research of psychic phenomena.\n\nOne man who works at the research centre is 37-year-old Nguyen Phac Bay and is said to have found over 500 bodies last year. The film also follows one female psychic through minefields and jungles in search of the dead. Nam Ngia, an ex-army nurse, works alone and has devoted her life to the task of finding those who went missing during the war. Apparently, when she is said to be speaking to the lost spirits, they pass on details that shock the living relatives - details they swear no one else could know. It may seem unlikely, but in Vietnam and much of South East Asia many believe that contact with dead ancestors is normal - that the dead can connect to the living.This film raises the question of what is belief and what is hope when so many are mourning the missing from the Vietnam War.\n\n",

But it is only with art and science combined that man has been able to fully understand and illustrate what lies beneath our skin. Tracing the rich history of this intimate relationship, this series explores how the advances of science transformed art, charting man's growing understanding of anatomy through the works that recorded and reflected it. Celebrating the great and the gruesome, the first-class and the foolish, this series offers a considered and illuminating insight into a fascinating subject.\n\n",

The prince argues that the arrival of the Portuguese court in Brazil, who escaped from Napoleon's occupation, did much to establish the institutions that have enabled Brazil's economy to flourish.\n\nMichael joins Carolina Ferraz, star of a galaxy of telenovellas, the immensely popular Brazilian soap operas, on the backlot of her most recent TV success, where issues of poverty fuel the storylines alongside the racier love triangles.\n\nWhilst taking to the skies of Sao Paolo to avoid the hundred-mile traffic jams with mega-rich king of waste disposal Wilson Quintela, Michael learns that there are millions to be made from garbage.\n\nTravelling south to Blumenau and Pomerode, Michael finds German speakers - including model Priscilla Falaster, who dreams of becoming the next Giselle Bundchen - and tries his hand pulling steins from a mobile bierkeller. Bavarian schulplatte dancers and chance encounters with spiritualists including Marcello Paes Leme challenge his views on what makes a typical Brazilian.\n\nLeaving the beauty and serenity of the Pantanal, Michael comes to his journey's end at the magnificent Iguazu falls, where he concludes that Brazil has much to offer the world as it takes its place as a new superpower.\n\n",

He visits an old gold mine once owned by the British, before going to see a vast opencast iron ore mine that is such a feature of the Minas landscape. Iron ore deposits that are fuelling Brazil's economic miracle but there is always an environmental price to pay, and Michael meets some ordinary Brazilians who are dedicated to preserving the natural beauty of the state.\n\nAfter Minas it's down to Rio de Janeiro, host to the next Olympics and World Cup. Rio has always had a reputation as a party town but also has suffered from terrible violence, with heavily armed drug gangs controlling the notorious shanty towns or favelas that make up a large part of the city. Now, the authorities have decided to spend some of Brazil's new money on healing the rift between the favelas and the rest of the city. The policy of 'pacification' aims to drive the drug gangs out and fund new infrastructure and social programmes to make the favelas truly part of the city. Michael visits what used to be some of the most violent places on Earth to see how lives have been transformed by pacification.\n\nMichael's time in Rio isn't all about what is happening in the favelas. He also finds time to visit some of Rio's best-known locations, learns how to celebrate a goal like a Brazilian radio commentator, and books a room in one of the city's infamous 'love hotels'!\n\n",

Billy strolls around America's largest funeral convention, discovering the hundreds of ways that you can put someone in the ground, on the moon, in a diamond or even turn them into a mushroom! He also catches up with old friend Eric Idle to discuss how the Monty Python star's Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life has become one of the UK's most played funeral songs, and ponders what music he'd choose as a part of his own final send off.\n\n",

But at one time England controlled India, helping to create its major cities, and was heavily invested in China, It was England's economy and trade that dwarfed others. And it was all in the hands of the first and greatest multi-national company: the behemoth that was the East India Company. On the ground in India, Dan Snow sets out to discover the motives of those who set up the company at the beginning of the seventeeth century. How did it grow into an Imperial power?

In this bold and refreshing take on the novel, acclaimed screenwriter Gwyneth Hughes imagines how the story might have ended.\n\nIt is 1842 and John Jasper is a local choirmaster in the tiny cathedral town of Cloisterham. He hates everything about his life - his only respite comes from an addiction to his opium pipe.\n\nFor Jasper hides a dark secret that plagues his dreams - he is obsessed with one of his pupils, the beautiful Rosa. An orphan who lives at the local Seminary for Young Ladies, Rosa senses the intensity of his feelings and both fears and loathes her teacher.\n\nJasper also knows he can never declare how he feels because Rosa will soon be married to his orphan nephew Edwin Drood. At night, under the influence of opium, Jasper dreams of murdering Edwin so Rosa can be his.\n\nThe arrival of Helena and Neville Landless, orphan twins from Ceylon, marks a turning point in all of their lives. Smitten by Rosa and instantly disliking Edwin, the hottempered Neville struggles to hide his feelings and the pair quarrel.\n\nIn a drug-fuelled moment, Jasper sees an opportunity to make his dreams reality. He can murder Edwin, blame Neville and claim Rosa for himself. The next morning Edwin is missing and Neville is under suspicion. Did Jasper go through with his plan?\n\n\"This was beyond grand\" -- Observer\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Adapted by award-winning writer Andrew Davies from Alan Hollinghurst's Booker Prizewinning novel, this three-part drama serial is set during the hedonistic 1980s and stars a mix of young talent and established names.\n\nThis is a story of love, class, sex and money, crawling deep under the skin of 1980s Britain. Framed by the two general elections of the decade, which returned Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative government to power, The Line Of Beauty spans four extraordinary years of tragedy and change.\n\nNick Guest, a young, gay Oxford graduate of modest means, is invited to stay with the wealthy Fedden family at their home in west London. Dysfunction and glamour come in equal measure with the Feddens, headed by father Gerald, a Tory MP and an empty man, who is consumed by his rising status within the party, wife Rachel who barely recognises her manic-depressive daughter Catherine, and son Toby, for whom Nick has had a secret crush ever since their time together at Oxford.\n\nDuring his stay with the Feddens, Nick experiences every extreme of the boom time eighties, from falling head-over-heels in love for the first time, to drug-induced highs and lows, via waltzing with the Prime Minister. Amidst the euphoria of the champagne and parties, the young graduate witnesses political scandal, the deception and hypocrisy of the rich and the desperate tragedy of the outbreak of AIDS.\n\nThis outsider's journey into the heart of the beautiful and seductive world of the social elite bristles with emotion, drama and social commentary. Full of style and wit, this is a richly textured coming-ofage story, set against the backdrop of a ruthless decade.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "From acclaimed writer Andrew Davies comes this enchanting adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel about love and marriage.\n\nLeft penniless after their father's death, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood face an uncertain future. They need to marry well if they are to retain their comfortable existence.\n\nWith a number of possible suitors - the intelligent and charming Mr Edward Ferrars, the handsome Mr John Willoughby and the more thoughtful and compassionate Colonel Brandon - they seem to have their share of options. But is there more to these men than first impressions suggest? What is the history between Willoughby and Brandon? And what secret is Ferrars hiding?\n\nThe story follows the sisters' very different approaches to love and marriage. Romantic and impulsive, Marianne falls in love deeply, but will not heed her sister's warning that her behaviour will leave her open to gossip and innuendo. Sensitive to social convention, her sister Elinor tries to conceal her own romantic disappointment, even from those closest to her. The sisters must learn that sense should mix with sensibility if they are to find personal happiness in a society where status and money govern the rules of love.\n\nAndrew Davies has proven himself to be the master of literary adaptation, from classics, such as Bleak House, to the politics and drug-fuelled sex and hedonism of the 1980s in The Line of Beauty. An excellent script combined with an outstanding cast means that Austen fans will be waiting in anticipation for this adaptation.\n\n\"Andrew Davies's superb new adaptation of Jane Austen's novel is so watchable, above and beyond the usual classic adaptations. What makes it exceptional, I think, is the immense warmth between the characters - particularly the mother and her daughters - that compels the viewer to care deeply what becomes of them all.\" The Times\n\n",

Taking a job in Post Office in Candleford, run by the mercurial Dorcas, she turns her back on her childhood hamlet to make her way in the world. With her loyalties divided, she must choose her own path to womanhood...\n\nWhile Laura's relationship with Dorcas is the show's emotional heart, Lark Rise to Candleford draws on a rich ensemble cast for a strong serial element, pointing up the little conflicts, romances and misunderstandings between the tiny Lark Rise and the more worldly Candleford. Laura feels these tensions through her own very private tug of love, as Dorcas and Laura's family back home seem to pull her in different directions.\n\n\"Beautifully observed and splendidly acted ... There are comic cameos by Liz Smith and Dawn French, but it is Olivia Hallinan's assured performance as Laura that stands out.\" -- Guardian\n\n",

Magwitch orders the terrified boy to steal a file from his uncle's forge to remove his shackles. When Pip returns, he brings food as well as the file - an innocent act of kindness that has far reaching consequences for them both.\n\nMeanwhile, Miss Havisham, the reclusive owner of the grand and dilapidated Satis House, requests Pip's presence as a playmate to her adopted daughter, the cold-hearted but beautiful Estella. Just as Pip begins to believe that Miss Havisham is planning a future for him beyond the marshes, his hopes are dashed when she reveals she is paying for him to join his uncle as a blacksmith.\n\nEverything changes when Jaggers, a lawyer from London, makes a surprise visit. Pip is now a young man of great expectations and will inherit a fortune when he reaches 21. There is only one condition. Pip must not enquire into the identity of his benefactor. With his heart set on seeing Estella again, Pip leaves his family and all he knows to embark on a new life in London as a gentleman.\n\nPart thriller, part mystery, this is an epic tale of obsession, corruption, revenge, redemption and forgiveness. With the shadow of the gallows always present, it is a story of what we will do, what we will risk and just how far we will go for love.\n\n\"Within minutes of starting the first episode I found myself... gripped\" -- Daily Telegraph\n\n\"Unreservedly recommended\" -- Guardian\n\n",

    "synopsis": "A young man sets his own tragic downfall in motion with one simple but horrifying act\n\nSet in St Petersburg in the second half of the 19th Century, this is Dostoevsky's disturbing tale of Raskolnikov, a highly intelligent, strikingly handsome and thoroughly conceited young student who, full of misplaced theory and pathologically stirred by the cruelty and injustice he sees around him, decides to test his courage and integrity by killing a miserable old pawnbroker - whom he is sure nobody will miss.\n\nRaskolnikov's crime goes seriously awry, and a wily investigator sets up a complex series of traps, encounters and conversations, playing with Raskolnikov's intelligence and arrogance. Slowly, Raskolnikov incriminates himself - and eventually confesses.\n\nDostoevsky's Crime and Punishment is the king of detective stories, the king of murder stories and the king of psychological thrillers. But, as an undoubted masterpiece of world literature, it goes far beyond the mere mechanics of its extraordinary plot to take on the tragic force of myth.\n\nRaskolnikov is the quintessential antihero - a Hamlet of his time. He is one of the sexiest characters in literature because, despite being a murderer, he is young, impassioned, lonely and lost.\n\nThis modern version of Crime and Punishment, with its sexy young cast, is a philosophical but deeply engaging portrait of a man who seals his fate by committing a single dire act of murder. Raskolnikov attempts to escape the implications of his crime, but he is left tormented and alienated from society in this classic moral tale by one of Russia's most celebrated novelists.\n\n\"Grim, paranoiac and involving throughout.\" -- Guardian\n\n\"...tremendously effective at conveying both the mood and moral import of the novel.This is serious television, the kind that the BBC is best at ...

    "synopsis": "Acclaimed writer Andrew Davies turns his talents to one of Charles Dicken's most brilliant novels - arguably the greatest ever depiction of Victorian London, from its glittering heights to its very lowest depths - adapting it into a series of half-hour episodes.\n\nAn all-star cast come together to bring this classic Dickens' novel to life. At the court of Chancery, the interminable suit of Jarndyce and Jarndyce becomes the centre of a web of relationships at all levels of society and a metaphor for the decay and corruption at the heart of Victorian England.\n\nAn epic feast of characters and storylines, Bleak House is a passionate indictment of the legal system that is as searingly relevant today as it was in the mid-19th Century. At its heart is the story of the icily beautiful Lady Dedlock, who nurses a dark secret, and the merciless lawyer Tulkinghorn, who seeks to uncover it. The generous John Jarndyce, struggling with his own past, and his two attractive young wards Richard and Ada, are all caught up, like Lady Dedlock, in the infamous case of Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce, which will make one of them rich beyond imagination if it can ever be brought to a conclusion. Esther Summerson, is a girl without a past, whom Jarndyce takes under his wing as a companion for Ada, but with whom he falls in love, and whose connection with Lady Dedlock may bring ruin to them both.\n\nThe cast of supporting characters contains some of Dickens' most famous creations - Smallweed, the evil moneylender; Krook, the first (and possibly last) man in literature to die by spontaneous combustion; Guppy, the ambitious young clerk, infatuated with Esther; Bucket the ice-cool police inspector, at the centre of fiction's first ever whodunit; and Little Jo, the young crossing sweeper, whose tragic death almost brought Victorian England to a standstill.\n\n",

Will a chance meeting change her future?\n\nThis gripping new series by Andrew Davies brings to life Dickens's powerful story of struggle and hardship in 1820s London. When Arthur Clennam returns to England after many years abroad, his curiosity is piqued by the presence in his mother's house of a young seamstress, Amy Dorrit.\n\nThe cold and forbidding Mrs Clennam isn't usually given to charity, so why has she made an exception in taking on Amy? Is she making reparations for a past wrongdoing? Arthur's quest to discover the truth takes him to the Marshalsea Prison for Debt. Here he meets and befriends Amy's father, William Dorrit, the prison's longest serving inmate. As he tries to help the Dorrits, Arthur discovers that the dark shadow of debt stretches far beyond the walls of the Marshalsea Prison, to affect the lives of many. Just as it is possible to climb to the very top in London Society's intricate game of snakes and ladders, so it is possible to slip right down.\n\nBut if the daring and adventurous Arthur succeeds in unravelling the mystery of his family's past, where will it leave him in the scheme of things? And where will it leave the Dorrits?\n\n\"Little Dorrit...is turning into one of the most compelling TV productions of the year\" -- Daily Mail\n\n\"The BBC does these costume dramas so well ITV doesn't even attempt them...They're what the BBC does best\" -- Daily Mirror\n\n",
