But Fatimetu is torn between life in the desert and her memories of her family and friends in Spain.\n\nWith unprecedented access to the Sahrawi community, Pedro Perez Rosado, provides a voice to this unrepresented group of refugees and their struggle for independence. The outstanding performance of newcomer Nadhira Mohamed, who was herself born in a refugee camp in Tinduf, landed her the Best Actress award at the Abu Dhabi Film Festival.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "David Frank is suing God. When we meet David, this formerly successful attorney -- shattered by his wife's death -- spends days in his bathrobe with his only real companion, his beloved bulldog, Brutus.\n\nWhile visiting his beloved niece Lucy near Orlando, a tornado threatens to destroy David's house. He races home in a heroic effort to save poor Brutus, but is stopped by the police and watches helplessly as the dark funnel of destruction sucks up the house, and the dog, like a Wizard of Oz nightmare. Then, adding insult to injury, the Insurance Company tells him they won't pay because the damage falls under the 'Act of God' clause in his policy. David is livid. But then he gets the bright idea to sue God Himself for damages, naming representatives of all different faiths as co-defendants.\n\nFueled by a megalomaniacal and opportunistic judge, a beautiful but damaged defense attorney, and David Frank's own sharply-honed legal gymnastics, what starts out as a crazy, radical stunt ultimately becomes a very deep and soulful journey.\n\nWinner of the Audience Award for Best First Narrative Feature at the Maui Film Festival. Winner of Best of Fest at the Real to Reel Film and Video Festival.\n\n",

Mr. Sinatra deserves a special chunk of praise...In SUDDENLY he [is] a melodramatic tour de force.\" - Bosley Crowther, The New York Times\n\n",

However, after an injunction keeps the men from their protest, the gender roles are reversed. As the women protest at the picket lines while the men stay at home, SALT OF THE EARTH makes glaringly clear the vital importance of women in the fight against inequality on intersecting fronts.\n\nChosen to be preserved by the National Film Preservation Board, USA.

He hones his craft by making an extremely successful commercial spot for his uncle's kebab stand. Ibo's a hit and life is delicious...until his German girlfriend Titzi tells him she's pregnant.\n\nAfter Ibo's panicked reaction, Titzi dumps him. His parents, upset that he impregnated a German, kick him out of the house. Worst of all, his second commercial is a flop! Stewing in frustration, he gives in to the temptations of the rival Greek restaurant-owner across the street (and his beautiful daughter!) and agrees to make a commercial spot for his uncle's worst enemy. When the local mafia gets involved, Ibo can finally put his Kung-Fu talents to the test.\n\n\"Cheery Slapstick...timing is immaculate.\" J.R.

    "synopsis": "A blend of fiction and historical evidence, Random 8 explores issues raised by several famous psychological experiments, including the work of Stanley Milgram at Yale University in the 1960s who studied human obedience to orders, even when the orders were \"immoral\" or caused pain to others. Inspiration also came from the work of American sociologist, Bill Gamson and colleagues, in which groups were asked to carry out unjust requests made by an authority figure.\n\nFrom one of Australia's most distinctive filmmakers, Random 8 is an eerily compelling film with a futuristic \"sci-fi\" surface, and at heart a thought-provoking essay about some of the big questions of our post-war era. In groups we are told what to do, but do we always do so? Do groups give us courage to obey or do they inhibit us? How do protest and change emerge? A randomly selected group of eight people from all walks of life are brought together in a bare room, mobile phones are confiscated, and cameras record their reaction to a series of instructions that escalate in intensity and in degree of challenge. Millard's interest in \"social theatre\", in using performance to explore human behaviour, has given us, in Random 8, a remarkable exercise in \"structured improvisation\".\n\nMade with a minimal budget but maximising dramatic effect through the austere setting and the \"real time\" shooting, the film is an elegant, emotionally intense example of a form of \"new cinema\" led by artists and ideas rather than traditional film industry conventions. This is cinema that may be low-budget but is not \"low-fi\": it is about big ideas, aimed at wide audiences, and has high aspirations as cinematic art.\n\nWith: Kate Box, Nicholas Brown, Tina Bursill, Jeanette Cronin, Matthew Edgerton, Ksenja Logos, Ivy Mak, Ned Manning, Gibson Nolte, Tim Spencer, Elaine Hudson and Mark Evans.\n\nDirected by Kathryn Millard.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Bolivia's official submission to the 87th Academy Awards, THE FORGOTTEN is a thrilling movie about Operation Condor, under which the United States undermined democracy and supported brutal dictatorships througout Latin America.\n\nRetired General Jose Mendieta (Damian Alcazar) is haunted by his dark past as an officer in Operation Condor, the CIA-backed campaign of political repression in Latin America that was responsible for executions, torture, and imprisonments in the 1970's. It is estimated that over 400,000 people were imprisoned and 30,000 forcibly disappeared as a result of these government actions.\n\nIn a letter to his son Pablo (Bernardo Pena), Mendieta confesses the role he played in the abduction, persecution, and execution of countless men and women during his posting to Chile. Journalist Marco (Carlotto Cotta) and his pregnant wife Lucia (Carla Ortiz) are among those who were arrested, along with their activist friend Antonio (Tomas Fonzi) and revolutionary Andrea (Ana Calentano). They suffer terribly under Mendieta and his cohort Sanera (Rafael Ferro), which leads to a cascade of betrayals, secrets, and stolen lives that spans generations.\n\nTHE FORGOTTEN has been screened at dozens of international festivals and has earned six Platino nominations and recently won 4 Maya Awards.\n\n",

    "language": "English",
    "release_year": 2013,
    "synopsis": "Akin and Mary meet for the first time at Lagos airport where they accidentally run into each other and mistakenly swap their identical phones. This in turn also leads to a cross wiring of travel destinations. Consequently, Akin ends up travelling to where Mary is supposed to go and vice-versa. Neither knows about the swap until they have reached their opposite destinations. In Mary's case 'her' phone (Akin's) stops ringing whereas 'Akin's' (Mary's) phone won't stop ringing. As a result, armed with the information and data on each other's phone, they agree to help carry out each other's mission. New obstacles and complications arise at every turn as they both struggle to adapt to their alien environments.\n\n\"They're calling you \"the Scorsese of Lagos\" - no pressure then. That's what the New York Times recently headlined its piece, and Kunle Afolayan's ambitions to shake up the industry now known (more great expectations) as Nollywood. With three films under his belt since he started directing in 2005 - which, by frantic west-African standards, makes him more the Kubrick of Lagos - the 38-year-old has become a byword for elevated quality: shooting on 35mm, releasing in cinemas, trying to improve on horribly stilted Nollywood formulas that seem to place more emphasis on gaudy soft furnishings than on dialogue and camerawork. Actually, Afolayan would prefer it if you called him the Mel Gibson of Lagos. \"I always show Apocalypto to my crew, because of the language thing. I say to them: 'You don't necessarily have to shoot your film in English for it to be good. You can do Swahili, you can do any language, you can even do no language at all.'\" Gibson's not an obvious renaissance-man idol - but crossing boundaries, having international aspirations, is the path forward for Afolayan and what is becoming known as the New Nollywood. The old Nollywood had no time for film festivals. When I speak to the director, he's just touched down in Amsterdam for the Africa in the Picture jamboree, where he is shopping his comedy drama Phone Swap. Next up is London, for the Film Africa festival.\" - The Guardian.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Guernica is both a town that was leveled in a night of horror during World War II and an image, captured in paint by Pablo Picasso and on film by renegade surrealist Fernando Arrabal. The Guernica Tree is Arrabal's most unflinching and personal film. It is a testimony to the horrors of war, the absurd chaos of life turned upside down and the ache of love. The fictional town of Villa Romero is the set upon which the events of Spain's civil war play out. Villa Romero is home to Vandale (Mariangela Melato) a witch, count Cerralbo (Bento Urago) a powerless land baron, and his four sons. Three of Cerralbo's sons are ruthless sadists who pillage the countryside, but the fourth, Goya (ron Faber), is an artist challenging authority and the church. When Vandale and Goya fall in love they become embroiled in the chaos of war and more ever closer to the doom that awaits in Guernica. The Guernica Tree is a wrenching experience, a headlong exploration of war and humanity. It is a film of shocking power and brutal design and is not recommended for the faint of heart. This is Guernica as only Arrabal can show it.\n\n",

A young, inexperienced governess is hired to look after two small children abandoned by their uncle, following the death of their parents, at his grand country house. Unsettled by glimpses of ghostly figures that only she can see, she quickly believes that something malevolent is stalking the children in her care. She learns that her predecessor and her sinister lover both died under curious circumstances and prior to their death, they spent most of their time with Flora and Miles. Could they be the figures appearing to the new governess? But are appearances everything they seem to be? Are these apparitions truly supernatural or simply products of her overactive imagination? James' novel is brilliantly brought to life in this evocative drama - full of ambiguity, eeriness and menace.\n\n",

As in classic film noir stories, but filled with comedy, fatality, manipulation, jealousy, passion, and the right amount of dark surrealism are the main ingredients of a children's story about the power of imagination and the price that you sometimes pay for simply loving.\n\nWinner of Best Director at the CinEuphoria Awards.\n\n",

A young bride escapes her wedding ceremony with a stranger and together they set off on an epic journey though increasingly bizarre lands. They encounter talking animals and mournful exhibitionists, converse with a discoursing rock, journey through a surrealist's psychedelic hotel, instigate a prison riot, escape from naked cannibals living in a tree and battle a wind-up midget dictator! The Howl challenges authority and convention in the true anarchist spirit of the 1960s. Filmmaker Tinto Brass, famous for his later erotica, here presents one of the greatest works of the era - along with A Clock Work Orange, a film he was asked to direct, but instead made The Howl; one of the strangest films ever!\n\nWarning: This film contains graphic content and may be upsetting and/or offensive to some people\n\n",

    "release_year": 1903,
    "synopsis": "The genesis of the motion picture medium is vividly recreated in this unprecedented collection of the cinema's formative works. More than crucial historical artifacts, these films reveal the foundation from which the styles and stories of the contemporary cinema would later arise.\n\nAn animated rendering of Eadweard Muybridge's primitive motion studies (1877-85) begins the program, immediately defining the compound appeal of cinema as both a scientific marvel and sensational popular entertainment.\n\nThis is followed by the works of Louis and Auguste Lumiere, who offer cinematic glimpses of such commonplace sights as children quarreling, a lion in a zoo or the feeding of poultry.\n\nAs for more obvious fictions there is the myth-making of Edwin S. Porter's seminal The Great Train Robbery (1903) and the pictorial splendor of Ferdinand Zecca's The Golden Beetle (1907), both presented in mint condition prints with the original hand-tinting, as well as Georges Melies's extravagant A Trip To The Moon (1902, complete with narration penned by the director, intended to accompany its performance).\n\nThe low art origins of the cinema are represented in some of Thomas Edison's Kinetoscopes (1894-97, serpentine dances, a cockfight, a bedroom full of seminary girls engaged in a pillow fight and the notorious first screen kiss) and a collection of mechanized peep shows from American Mutoscope and Biograph, whose burlesque origins are free from social or aesthetic pretense, being designed solely for titillation and amusement. When social crusaders spoke of the evils of film, this is what they had in mind.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Dr Paul Carruthers [Bela Lugosi] appears to all of Heathville as a kindly doctor and research scientist for Heath-Morton Cosmetics, Ltd. But in his secret laboratory, Carruthers is actually conducting personal experiments--one of which is a formula for an oriental shaving lotion; another is the creation of a giant bat who hates the smell of the lotion. Bitter because founding fathers Martin Heath [Edward Mortimer] and Henry Morton [Guy Usher] got rich on his formulas while he himself is awarded with menial bonuses, Carruthers plans to sic his giant bat on their families.\n\nFirst to go is Roy Heath [John Ellis]. Investigative reporter Johnny Layton [Dave O'Brien] and cameraman 'One Shot' McGuire [Donald Kerr] of the Chicago Register are sent to snoop for a story. The only clues are the victim's neck wounds that look like they were made by the beak and talons of a bird, a peculiar faint odor about the wounds, and some mouse or bat hairs. That afternoon, Layton and McGuire have tea with Carruthers and Martin's daughter Mary [Suzanne Kaaren], and Layton and Mary become smitten with each other. Mary invites Layton to come back to the estate that evening.\n\nThat evening, Johnny sees Martin's son Tommy [Alan Baldwin] attacked in the garden by a giant bat. When Don Morton [Gene O'Donnell], son of the other founding father, Henry Morton, is subsequently killed in the same way, Layton finds a bottle of shaving lotion of the same scent discovered on all the bodies. In an attempt to provide a picture of the 'devil bat', McGuire photographs a fake bat which is proven fraudulent by a scientist on a talk radio program. Layton and McGuire are fired by their paper, but they stay in Heathville to get to the bottom of the story. They trace the lotion to Carruthers and interview him in an attempt to expose him, but he readily admits to creating the formula. He even gives Layton a bottle to try. That night, Layton and McGuire are dive-bombed by the giant bat, which Layton kills. The size of the bat has scientists marvelled, and Layton and McGuire are exonerated and rehired.\n\nCarruthers creates a new devil bat and sics it on Henry Morton. That night a giant bat attempts to get into Mary's bedroom, and it is learned that someone has switched her perfume with formula. While Carruthers tends Mary, Layton visits his laboratory. He waits for Carruthers to return and follows him into his secret lab where Carruthers releases the devil bat. Layton asks Carruthers for a bottle of the lotion and informs him that he intends to sit in the garden and hopefully attract the bat with it. Layton even invites Carruthers to watch, but he splashes lotion on Carruthers and the bat ultimately kills Carruthers\n\n",

    "synopsis": "An adaptation of the popular Michael Frayn stage-play based around a strange trip the German physicist Werner Heisenberg made to Copenhagen in 1941 to see his Danish counterpart Niels Bohr. Old friends and close colleagues, they had revolutionised atomic physics in the 1920s with their work together. But now the world had changed and the two men were on opposite sides in a world war. The meeting was fraught with danger and embarrassment and ended in disaster. In Frayn's play, Heisenberg meets Bohr and his wife Margrethe once again to look for the answers and to work out how we can ever know why we do what we do.\n\n",

    "title": "The Sons of Matthew",

    "synopsis": "Landmark Australian 1949 epic of \"How the West Was Won\" proportions Sons of Matthew, based on a true family exploration story set in the astonishing beauty of incredible rugged hinterland on the far north coast of Sydney, was a major film in its day. I saw it in 1995 as a new 35mm print screened in a luxury cinema. The impact of this huge cinematic success is undiminished and viewers today will be equally as impressed. Just to film this epic would be a feature in itself rather like Burden Of Dreams is to Fitzcarraldo. Produced by Oz Industry statesman Charles Chauvel, Sons of Matthew was one of many films he created celebrating the Australian pioneering spirit. The major change to tastes and perceptions today would be the horror at the immediate destruction the family wreak on massive trees and forest in their effort to '\"tame the land\" . This century it is seen as environmental vandalism on an unprecedented and wasteful scale. There are several scenes of absolutely massive ancient trees with buttress roots 50 feet high that are slowly (hand)sawn down that crash violently through pristine mountain forest, destroying acres of breathtaking untouched jungle landscape. This is 'King Kong' looking territory. The men wedged high up the trunk look like ants sawing at an elephant's leg. Apart form that, Australia was not restricted by the same tedious censorship restrictions as the American Hayes code, and in several very revealing scenes, the male and female cast are seen swimming stark naked in waterfalls and mountain ponds. Absolutely nude, as one would do when enjoying some stripped recreation in the lusty throb of taming virgin territory. Chauvel went on to make many other films, the most notable also revealing the brutal ploughing of native Australia is seen in the breathtaking color feature Jedda in 1956.\n\n",

Told from the perspective of Wilma Mankiller and full-blood Cherokee organizer Charlie Soap, these leaders join forces to battle opposition and build a 16-mile waterline system using a community of volunteers.\n\nIn the process, they inspire the townspeople to trust each other, to trust their way of thinking, and to spark a reawakening of the universal indigenous values of reciprocity and interconnectedness. This project also inspired a self-help movement in Indian Country that continues to this day. The movie is dedicated to Wilma Mankiller's vision, compassion and incredible grace.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Miss Mend, an action-packed adventure serial in three feature-length episodes, was produced in Russia with the goal of rivaling, and possibly even surpassing, the most entertaining American movies of the 1920s. Instead of the avant-garde works of Sergei Eisenstein and Dziga Vertov, Russian audiences were enchanted by fast-moving American films starring serial queens like Pearl White, swashbuckling heroes like Douglas Fairbanks, and comedians from the Keystone Cops to Lloyd, Keaton and Chaplin.\n\nMiss Mend meets them all head-on and hardly stops for breath. It features beautiful location photography, impressive stunt scenes; horse, car and boat chases, radio towers, jazz bands and even a spectacular train wreck, interspersed with visual references to German film classics like Nosferatu, Caligari and Dr. Mabuse, The film's heroine, Vivian Mend, is an elegant urban professional who earns her own living and raises a child without the help of any man. But the film, partially set in an imagined America where everything is new and progressive (from technology to social relations and lifestyles) also includes a few more-than-pointed comments on labor relations, racism, excessive wealth, gratuitous violence and even rape.\n\n",

Jaded by the \"incestuous, New York, socialite shit\" that sells at prominent art galleries, Nate (Keith Poulson) embarks on a quest for a more authentic brand of contemporary art. When a coked-up YouTube search leads to a music video from Delawarean Goth rappers Young Torture Killers, an Insane Clown Posse knock-off, Nate knows he's found his subjects. He soon drags his friend-with-benefits Bernadette (Sophia Takal) to rural Delaware to shoot the group playing in their parents' basement. To \"immerse himself\" in the group's culture and add an extra layer of realism to his work, Nate befriends the rappers and makes return trips to get to know them. But as his relationship with group develops, he becomes increasingly aware that, while you can take the boy out of the art world, you can't take the art world out of the boy.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Starring a seventeen-year-old beauty-contest winner, DEADLY SWEET is a most unusual crime story. In the film, a French actor finds his business contact lying murdered on the floor. Rather than call the police, he decides to protect the young woman at the scene and nail down the true killers, putting him on a collision course with the London underworld. DEADLY SWEET leads us through a mind-bending series of pop-art visuals by renowned erotic cartoonist Guido Crepax with split screens (and triple split screens) and the seductive rock score by Armando Trovajoli. Filmmaker Tinto Brass (who later gained fame for his soft-core erotic), wrote the screenplay in 1967, loosely adapted from a novel by Sergio Donati, as an outrageous attempt to turn the crime genre on its head. It can be said that with this film, Cinema Fumetti (comic-book movies) was invented prior to the more known DANGER: DIABOLIK and BARBARELLA.\n\n",

The starting point is a 1911 film by Swedish explorer Erland Nordenskiold. But today's reality turns out to be much more intense than the nostalgia for a lost world.\n\nIn Yvy Maraey, the white man (the director) and the Indian create and interpret their own characters, walking the thin line between documentary, fiction, and performance. Far from observing another culture, we are watched and questioned about our identity in a country undergoing enormous social, political, and historical change as it struggles to create an intercultural society. Yvy Maraey is a quest for the knowledge within, seen through the eyes of the other. Here learning comes from another form of seeing--listening. The film combines reality with the epic tale of a heroic indigenous nation.\n\n",

    "release_year": 1956,
    "synopsis": "Unseen theatrically since the early 1970s and never before broadcast or issued on home video, Seven Wonders of the World has been digitally remastered from its original camera negatives. The global adventure captures the beauty and culture of these extraordinary places in a Cinerama time capsule.\n\nOf the seven sites the ancient Greeks named the \"wonders of the world,\" only one remains. Seven Wonders of the World is a round-the-world adventure that picks up where the Greeks of antiquity left off. Released in 1956, this Cinerama spectacle follows 20th century adventurer Lowell Thomas as he seeks out the Seven Wonders of the Modern World. Join him as he flies across the globe in the \"Smasher,\" a converted B-25, capturing some of the most breathtaking photography ever shot.\n\nThe quest opens at the great pyramids, the last of the original Seven Wonders to still exist. From there, the \"Smasher\" circles the globe with Cinerama photographing a live East Africa volcano, under the bridges in New York, over and around Rio de Janeiro, the Parthenon in Athens, Angel Falls in South America, and many stops along the way to experience the beautiful culture of diverse locales. The film encourages the audience to choose from the dozens of sites explored. \"What are your seven wonders?\"\n\n",

This was the year when the surrealists Magritte, Dali and Bunuel brought their bizarre new vision to the people, and when emigre writers and musicians such as Ernest Hemingway and George Gershwin came looking for inspiration.\n\nParis in 1928 was where black musicians and dancers like Josephine Baker found adulation, where Cole Porter took time off from partying to write Let's Do It, and where radical architect Le Corbusier planned a modernist utopia that involved pulling down much of Paris itself.\n\n",

    "title": "The Marriage Circle",
    "language": "English, Silent",
    "release_year": 1924,
    "synopsis": "The tone is set from the opening scene as legendary director Ernst Lubitsch effortlessly sets up the duality of one perfectly happy marriage contrasted with another couple in a perpetual state of grimly endured misalliance.\n\nThe Marriage Circle is full of scenes with a sense of unspoken formality, of a mutually antagonistic marital standoff that has been going on for years. The move/countermove rhythm slightly anticipates the slow, tit-for-tat rhythms of Laurel and Hardy, but instead of escalating toward physical destruction, Lubitsch freezes the emotional temperature at a quiet, indicative irony. Unlike real people, these characters never lose their control, which is the essence of their absurdity, the soul of their wit.\n\nBefore this film, the audience could only see Lubitsch characters move; with The Marriage Circle, we begin to see them think. Before, there were large sets and hundreds of extras. Now, Lubitsch strips everything down to the essentials: a few actors, a car, a garden, a dining room, a staircase. Lubitsch's German films, even the fine ones, tend to be brass bands - compelling, funny, but unavoidably loud. With The Marriage Circle, Lubitsch became the composer of the cinema's finest, most elegant chamber music.\n\nTo see it in this glistening print derived from the original negative, with an appropriately lilting score by the Mont Alto Orchestra, is to fall in love with the movies - and Ernst Lubitsch - all over again.\n\n",

Of his later, larger-scale dramatic operas, the most widely heard is \"William Tell.\" This film features music from \"William Tell,\" The Barber of Seville\" and \"The Thieving Magpie.\" The story begins in a kitchen in Italy where little Reliana (Melissa Pirrera) helps her grandmother Rosalie (Frances Bay) make pasta sauce. As steam swirls magically through the kitchen, Rosalie argues with her oldest friend Martina (Lally Cadeau) and tells the story of an opera composer they once both knew.\n\nSoon, Reliana finds herself transported through time back to a theatre in Rome in 1816. She is invisible to everyone but the composer, Rossini. She watches in alarm as one of the singers puts a curse on the production and everything begins to go wrong. This was the year that \"The Barber of Seville\" had its disastrous premiere. Through the story, three women learn that friendship, like opera or great pasta sauce, requires nurturing, patience, and time.\n\n",

Friends disappear behind shuttered windows: his mother screams at the sight of him: his betrothed, married to another, hugs her children close to her as if to protect them from an unknown evil.\n\nThe soldier has only his book of riches and in time grows 'rich as rich can be', Wealth brings him no joy, however, and he longs to lose what he has gained so that he can re-gain what he has lost. Only when he has tricked the Devil into taking his last money away does he win himself a wife, a princess into the bargain, and find happiness again.\n\nBut the Devil, who has deceived him time after time, appearing as a gipsy woman, a former fellow soldier, a country gentleman, has sown seeds of discontent which, in the end, lead the soldier irrevocably to Hell.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "From 1913 to 1916, Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle rose from the ranks of bit player to writer, director and star of comedies for Mack Sennett's Keystone Film Company. Because of Sennett's belief that actors were interchangeable, he lost Arbuckle to producer Joseph M. Schenck, who not only paid the comedian handsomely, but also permitted him complete creative control. To help in the new venture, Arbuckle recruited Buster Keaton, popular star of a knockabout vaudeville act; Keaton took a large pay cut to act in motion pictures, and Arbuckle welcomed his ideas andtaught him all he knew about making movies. This volume of the collection presents films that Arbuckle and Keaton made for Schenck between 1917 and 1918; they are presented chronologically so we can watch Buster grow from Arbuckle's bit player to his full partner.\n\nFollowing the 1921 scandal that was inflamed by a publicity-seeking prosecutor and the tabloid press, Arbuckle's films were withdrawn from circulation in America, and the negatives were not preserved. The films in this collection were gathered from international archives and private collections. The English intertitles are new, and except for Coney Island, derived from non-English sources. All the films are digitally mastered from 35mm, sometimes directly from the nitrate originals.\n\n",

All told, this \"lost\" production remains a fascinating cinematic bridge between the 19th century barnstorming theatrical tradition and the new freedom of the feature film... as well as a cultural bridge between African-American and white popular entertainments.\n\n",

She has risked everything by marrying Frank (Nicholas Eadie), an Australian soldier on duty with the Occupation forces in Japan. Facing hostility from her own family, fearing rejection by her new mother-in-law, and facing humiliation from Australian government officials, she joins Frank in her new home in Melbourne.\n\nOver the next two decades, Aya battles to embrace a new country and its culture. As she gains strength and confidence, her marriage to Frank deteriorates into bitterness and violence. Her personal quest for fulfilment leads her eventually to Hobart and the start - yet again - of a new life for herself, but this time in full control of her own destiny.\n\nAya's story is not based on a particular case, but draws on the experiences of many war brides who made a home for themselves in Australia. Altogether, around 650 Japanese women married Australian soldiers and settled in Australia, and most have stayed. As in AYA, most of their children grew up not speaking Japanese; some women were even forbidden to speak Japanese to their children, as their husbands were worried about their children's assimilation.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Powerful independent full length feature film about the life of Mary Tudor, Henry VIII's first child. She was loved, she was a princess, heir to the throne - but the childhood fairy tale turned to a lifelong nightmare for Mary. When her father divorced her mother and married Anne Boleyn, Mary became an outcast and a threat to the Protestant succession. By a twist of fate, on the death of her brother, she became queen at last in 1553, but her attempts to make England Catholic again were a disaster for her and for England. History has called her \"Bloody Mary\" for the burning of the Protestants, but how fair is this? This film paints another picture, of a woman true to her beliefs, pushed towards a terrible psychological disintegration.\n\nRunner up Marbella Film Festival 2008.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "When the reserved, elderly Leo Colston comes across a childhood diary, he recalls the painful events of the summer that shaped his character - memories that have long since been locked away...\n\nFifty years earlier, a 12-year-old Leo is spending the long, hot summer of 1900 with the family of a schoolfriend, Marcus, at their elegant country mansion. Utterly in thrall to the glamorous Maudsley family and their guests, Leo is soon befriended by Marcus's beautiful older sister Marian, who persuades him to act as messenger between her and her lover Ted, a charismatic local farmer.\n\nMarian's overbearing mother is manoeuvring for her to marry Hugh Trimingham, a wealthy aristocrat who's been badly disfigured at war. But as Marian's clandestine affair becomes ever more intense, Leo is drawn into a complex game of deceit and desire. Struggling to comprehend his impossible situation, Leo becomes more bewildered, and as events hurtle out of control he is exposed to the harsh realities of this turbulent adult world.\n\nMoving and delicately drawn, The Go-Between is an unforgettable story about sex, class and the loss of innocence. This fresh, vital adaptation paints a striking portrait of life at the start of the 20th century, bringing L.P. Hartley's iconic novel to a new generation.\n\n",

While analyzing CCTV footage of the surrounding forest, she discovers she can reconfigure her perception to predict shifts in global financial markets. But when her inquisitive and demanding friend Charlie arrives at the house, Helen finds herself challenged and unsettled by her new colleague, and the two girls' relationship begins to unravel. From this cryptic premise grows a lo-fi mind-bender of intimate scale and startling relevance that flirts with sci-fi and horror conventions, even as it subverts them. To the strains of an electronic score, For the Plasma juxtaposes pastoral imagery with surveillance technology, every shade and shadow captured in gorgeous 16mm.\n\n",

Out in the wilderness he encounters the beauty of nature, and under the tutelage of a hermit named Marvel, becomes a \"normal homme.\" Aden falls desperately in love with Marvel, who can communicate with animals, the clouds, and the sun. Upon returning to civilization, Marvel in tow, Aden is more aware than ever of the hideous and hypocritical nature of human society. I WILL WALK LIKE A CRAZY HORSE has long been considred a masterpiece of surrealist film and stands as Arrabal's most delirious and devlish picture, and outrageous portrait of both other-wordly beauty and inner torment\n\n",

From the opening scenes when police break up a performance by the two groups and arrest one band member, the film is punctuated by run-ins between the young musicians and white authority.\n\nTo white viewers such incidents seem unreal, but the players, who helped write the script, insist that these events are typical for Black Australians. However, Wrong Side of the Road doesn't dwell on injustices. It shows a gutsy people standing up to a racist society, and also shows some of the features of black society that white Australians miss out on, especially the closeness of the black community. When the bands play, everyone, from young children to their grandparents, dances to their music. Wrong Side of the Road, the first ever Australian feature starring an all-Indigenous cast, is both inspiring and disturbing, and as relevant now as the day it was made.\n\n",

    "title": "Liszt's Rhapsody",
    "language": "English",

    "synopsis": "This is a story of Franz Liszt, prolific 19th-century Hungarian composer, virtuoso pianist, conductor, music teacher, arranger, organist, philanthropist, author, nationalist and a Franciscan tertiary. He gained renown in Europe during the early nineteenth century for his prodigious virtuosic skill as a pianist. Set in 1846, and featuring music from \"The Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2,\" \"Carnival in Pest\" and \"The Mephisto Waltz,\" this historical drama celebrates the inextinguishable flame of genuine talent. Franz Liszt (Geordie Johnson) was the equivalent of a rock star at his time: handsome, rich and famous. But he wanted to be more than simply Europe's most celebrated pianist. He wanted to compose great music, not just play it. In the story, a free-spirited Gypsy boy, Josy (Drew Jurecka), inspires a frustrated Liszt to reach his true potential. The boy is a young virtuoso who is perfectly happy playing his violin in the streets. Liszt only needs to hear Josy play once to know that the Gypsy boy could achieve true greatness with a bit of formal training. So, he arranges for Josy to come live with him and take lessons. Little does Liszt know that his own creativity will be transformed by the experience.\n\nThe film won the \"Seal of Quality\" from the Family Channel and \"Best Children's Program\" from KidsFirst!\n\n\"Best Children's Program\" -KidsFirst!**\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Aelita, The Queen Of Mars is a Socialist science fiction spectacle and in 1924 was the first big-budget movie from Soviet Russia. A year and a half in the making, it was intended as ideologically correct mass entertainment which could compete both in Russia and abroad with the Hollywood films that dominated Soviet and world screens while also earning plaudits for artistic innovation such as had greeted The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari and other German expressionist films.\n\nAelita is a fantastic adventure about Los, an engineer living in Moscow, who dreams of Aelita, the Queen of Mars, and builds a spaceship to take him to her. They fall in love, but Los soon finds himself embroiled in a proletarian uprising to establish a Martian Union of Soviet Socialist Republics! This story is based loosely upon a novella by Alexei Tolstoy, a distant relative of Leo Tolstoy, who had established a reputation for popular novels, poetry and drama before 1917 and who had just returned to Moscow after emigrating during the Revolution. The director, Yakov Protazanov, was a pre-Revolutionary Russian film giant who was persuaded to give up a successful new career in France and Germany to offer his skill and prestige to the untried Soviet film industry.\n\nThe most interesting element in this film - the basis for its enduring fame - is its design: amazing \"Martian\" costumes and sets by the distinguished abstract painter Alexandra Exter and her accomplished protZgZ, Isaak Rabinovich. Informed by cubism and other design trends in France, Italy and Germany, they are executed in the distinctively Russian avant-garde style of the day, known as \"constructivism.\"\n\nDespite its long inaccessibility, Aelita has survived in excellent condition. This bizarre and haunting work has at last been restored to view in a first class edition with new English intertitles and a new piano score by Alexander Rannie based upon vintage themes by Sergei Prokofiev.\n\n",

Galen used first hand experience to describe his anatomical observations in writing so detailed that later Persian translations included illustrations. After the fall of Constantiople, classical works influenced Renaissance thinkers and artists like Leonardo da Vinci, who also performed dissections to discover how the human body works. Following Galen's evidence based investigation, Andreas Vesalius performed public dissections in Padua, noting in detailed illustrations and descriptions the human skeleton, muscles, nerves,organ and brain. His illustrations were classically posed before a landscape, showing a body in motion. Vesalius is known as the Founder of Modern Anatomy because of his \"De Humani Corporis Fabrica\" (The Fabric of the Human Body), that is as artful as it is accurate. A BBC Production.\n\n",

Even Hollywood icon Charlie Chaplin, still the world's most recognized actor, introduced his beloved Tramp character under the auspices of Keystone. Later, under the Mack Sennett Comedies banner, Sennett went on to produce a new generation of sound comedies, some in early color, featuring the likes of W.C. Fields, Bing Crosby, Lloyd Hamilton, Andy Clyde, and more.\n\nNow, for the first time, thanks to Flicker Alley, CineMuseum, and Keystone Films, over 100 of the best surviving Sennett comedies have been gathered from around the world, fully restored, and digitally re-mastered.\n\nThese new editions have been painstakingly reconstructed by CineMuseum and Keystone Films using original 35mm nitrate, archival negatives, preservation materials, and sometimes the lone known surviving film print, from the collections of the Library of Congress, the Museum of Modern Art, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Blackhawk Films, Lobster Films, the Richard M.

Glimpses of life caught unawares are found in the home movies of Elizabeth Woodman Wright, Archie Stewart, Frank Stauffacher, and John C. Hecker. Poetic lyricism finds a voice in the city symphonies of Lynn Riggs' A Day in Santa Fe (1931) and Rudy Burckhardt's Haiti (1938). Professionally minded films, like Theodore Case's Sound Tests (c.1925) and Lewis Jacobs' Tree Trunk to Head (1938), operate from a similar home-spun perspective of sincerity.

Stella and Dot have been together for 31 years and have faithfully accompanied one another through life's ups and downs. Now in their seventies, Stella is hard of hearing and Dot is legally blind. Dotty's prudish granddaughter, Molly (played by Genie Award-winner Kristin Booth), decides the best place for Dot is a nursing home that will provide all the necessities. This forces Stella and Dot to make a bold decision: they will leave their hometown and make their way to Canada, where same-sex marriage is legal. It's a last-gap bid to stay together. En route to Canada, they pick up a young hitchhiker, Prentice, played by newcomer Ryan Doucette. A small-town boy turned modern dancer, he is returning to Nova Scotia to visit his dying mother. Despite his bravado, Prentice is a confused and wounded soul who has much to learn from Stella and Dot as they wage their own unexpected battle - after three decades, can they keep their family together?\n\n",

    "synopsis": "This version of Hunchback, featuring Lon Chaney was a huge production: the sets depicting 15th-century Paris covered nineteen acres of Universal Pictures' back lot and included the facade of Notre Dame Cathedral. Filming took six months and the climactic sequence employed two thousand extras, but it's Lon Chaney's performance that makes the character unforgettable. The Hunchback of Notre Dame premiered at New York's Astor Theatre on September 2, 1923. The success of the film was immediate; it made Carl Laemmle and Universal Pictures a fortune, and turned Lon Chaney into a screen legend.\n\nThis edition is mastered from a multi-tinted 16mm print struck in 1926 from the original camera negative. (The film apparently does not survive in 35mm). Visible wear in the source material is diminished with a moderate amount of digital restoration. It is pictorially much better than earlier video editions and represents the best condition in which this landmark film survives today. A new symphonic score arranged by Donald Hunsberger was recorded in the Czech Republic by full orchestra conducted by Robert Israel.\n\n",

However, there is another underlying evil that remains unspoken.

    "synopsis": "In 1927, Eisenstein and Pudovkin were both assigned to make films commemorating the 10th Anniversary of the 1917 Revolution. The results, October and The End of St. Petersburg, are two of the unforgettable masterpieces of epic filmmaking. Pudovkin's film, the more intensely dramatic and personal of the two, opens on a farm where a peasant must stay in the field and plow as his wife dies in childbirth. Trudging to the city to seek work, he is forced into scab labor. He tragically realizes the consequences of his mistake and violently attacks his employer. After jail, he is forced to join the army. World War I, in the best depiction yet of the horrors of battle, destroys all in its path as the bourgeois speculators grow rich. But the revolution frees St. Petersburg from the brutal yoke of the rich and there is born a new hope for the future. The New York Times remarked that \"one feels sometimes as though this film were a remarkable newsreel of the Russian Revolution.\n\n",

    "title": "Storm Over Asia",
    "language": "English, Silent",
    "release_year": 1928,
    "synopsis": "The last of the three great films that V.I. Pudovkin directed in the 1920s, Storm over Asia (1928) is an acknowledged classic of Soviet silent cinema. Filmed largely on location in Mongolia, the film has an authentic documentary feel, though the story is a stirring melodrama. It concerns a young fur trapper (Valeri Inkizhinov) who, after being captured and sentenced to death by British occupying forces, is mistaken as a descendant of the great warrior Genghis Khan. He then becomes a puppet ruler for the British in their war against the Soviet partisans. Once he attains his status, however, he must decide where his loyalties lay.\n\nPudovkin enjoys caricaturing the foreign (British) troops and the medieval rituals of a Buddhist temple, but it's out on the Siberian steppes that he really comes into his own, with panoramic shots of the vast landscapes. Together with Mother (1926) and The End of St. Petersburg (1927), Storm over Asia (also known as The Heir to Genghis Khan) entitles Pudovkin to be ranked with Sergei Eisenstein and Dziga Vertov as a master of the Soviet montage style, which he expounded in his book Film Technique (1929).\n\nThis edition has been transferred from 35mm preservation elements, and represents a more complete version of the film than has been previously released. A stirring score by Timothy Brock, as performed by the Olympia Chamber Orchestra, accompanies the film.\n\n",

    "title": "The Great Japanese Retirement",

    "synopsis": "In a world where people panic about the rising global population, Japan is facing a very different future which could see their population shrink by a third in just 40 years. One reason is that the Japanese are not having enough babies and the causes of that form the basis of Anita Rani's intriguing journey. The film explores Otaku culture - the world of nerds and geeks obsessed with computer games and Manga cartoons - which has led to a withdrawal of many Japanese men from the whole dating game. Anita meets two men in their late thirties who have in depth relationships with virtual teenage girlfriends as part of a role playing game: 'I think twice about going out with a 3D woman', says one.\n\nThe Japanese have far less sex than other nations and Anita also meets the women who struggle to work and have children in a society still dominated by traditional gender roles. Added to this, Japan also has the oldest population in the world, 25% are over 65 and 50,000 over a hundred years old. Anita visits a group of pensioners cheerleaders and a prison with a wing especially designed for pensioners. Too few young people to pay tax, too many old people needing support - it has all led to a debt problem worse than that of Greece and an uncertain future for a country that still is the third largest economy in the world.\n\n",

He struggles with the helmet-cam video footage of combat that he has brought back from Iraq: The video provides Johnny with the comfort of accuracy that memory does not have, but it also induces anxiety.

Winner of the Absolute Grand Prize at the 1954 Venice International Film Festival and nominated for a 1955 BAFTA film award for Best Documentary Film. The development of inland Australia largely depends on the men who keep open the supply lines and communications - the outback mailmen. In an area larger than Europe, beyond the last roads and railways, their tracks make the map of the inland, become the roads of tomorrow and mark the growth of the nation. Across the centre of Australia ran an ancient 300-mile track that was used by Aboriginal people trading between north and south. Commonly known as the Birdsville Track, joining Marree in South Australia to Birdsville in Queensland, it was the main thoroughfare for Tom Kruse to deliver mail and supplies to outlying cattle stations. The Back of Beyond follows his remarkable journey and celebrates the characters that define outback Australia.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "VIVA LA DANCE is part of the film retrospective UNSEEN CINEMA that explores long-forgotten American experimental cinema.\n\nDance and film have shared the aspiration to creatively sculpt motion and time. Some of the first films ever made featured Annabelle's skirt dance, hand-painted in glowing colors. Isadora Duncan and Ruth St. Denis' innovations found their way into Diana the Huntress (1916) and Soul of the Cypress (1920). Highly cinematic renditions of dance evolved in Stella Simon's Hande (1928) and Hector Hoppin's Joie de vivre (1934). In counterpoint, cine-dance experiments by Steiner, Bute, Fischinger, Crockwell, and Vorkapich dispensed with actual dancers in favor of color, shape, line, and form choreographed into abstract light-play.\n\n31 FILMS BY FEATURED DIRECTORS: Charles Allen, Grigory Alexandrov, Sara Kathryn Arledge, Frederick S.

    "title": "The Battle of the Sexes",
    "language": "English, Silent",
    "release_year": 1928,
    "synopsis": "D.W. Griffith is properly esteemed as the \"Father of Film\" from his years of discovery making short films at the pioneer Biograph Company and for such pioneering features as The Birth of a Nation, Intolerance, Broken Blossoms, Way Down East and Orphans of the Storm, but his later films - several of them lost or almost unavailable - are often dismissed as back efforts of a talent in decline. Griffith's 1928 comedy-drama The Battle of the Sexes belies this perception.\n\nThe story involves a middle-aged magnate (humanitarian Jean Hersholt, whose film performances extended from Greed to Dr. Christian) who makes a fool of himself when he strays from his loving but frowsy wife (Belle Bennett, so unforgettable in Stella Dallas) and children (Billy Bakewell and Sally O'Neill) into the cynical arms of a gold digger (Phyllis Haver) and her dishonest lover (Don Alvarado). As these characters are hurt and healed, Griffith expertly draws fine lines between tragedy and comedy, and his skill makes all the difference between emotional satisfaction and formulaic melodrama. Like so many of Griffith's earlier films, there must be elements of autobiography in this one, for the 53-year-old filmmaker's sympathy is all with the middle-aged philanderer whose relationships with women are no less myopic than Griffith's own.\n\nComing in the year of transition to sound, The Battle of the Sexes was originally released with synchronized recorded music, including an obligatory song. Griffith is reported to have been critical of the music, which has been lost in any case, but compilers Rodney Sauer and Susan Hall worked the song into the new score prepared for this edition and recorded in digital stereo by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra. The image has been digitally mastered from a vintage print made directly from the original camera negative.\n\n",

The American authors of avant-garde classics Ballet mecanique (1923-24), Anemic cinema (1926), and Nuit sur le Mont Chauve (1934) are finally acknowledged for their seminal artistic achievements made in Europe. Pioneer abstract films by Ralph Steiner, Mary Ellen Bute, Douglass Crockwell, Dwinnell Grant, and George Morris are compared and contrasted with Hollywood montages created by Ernst Lubitsch and Slavko Vorkapich. For the first time on video, composer George Antheil's original 1924 score accompanies Fernand Leger and Dudley Murphy's film Ballet mecanique, a truly avant-garde cacophony of image and sound.\n\n26 FILMS BY FEATURED DIRECTORS: Alexander Alexeieff, Oswell Blakeston, Rutherford Boyd, Al Brick, Francis Bruguiere, Mary Ellen Bute, Douglass Crockwell, Marcel Duchamp, W.J.

Cassatt often created images of the social and private lives of women with emphasis on the bonds between Mothers and their children. She was one of several successful Impressionists at the time, and a close friend of the artist Edgar Degas (Thomas Jay Ryan). In the story, Cassatt, played by Amy Brenneman of TV's \"Judging Amy,\" lives an ordered life in Paris until her brother and his wife arrive with their three unruly children.\n\nAt first dreading the presence of the children, she soon finds herself inspired by them and even uses them as models. Her teenage niece Katherine (Charlotte Sullivan), who believes that getting married is essential to positioning oneself in society, plays matchmaker between Cassatt and Edgar Degas. Though the match is not meant to be, Cassatt's feminist ideals greatly influence Katherine and change her life forever. Likewise, the influence of the children softens Cassatt and inspires her to renew stronger contact with her family back in Philadelphia.\n\n",

    "release_year": 1916,
    "synopsis": "Joan the Woman (Cardinal Film Corporation, 1916) was Cecil B. DeMille's first great spectacle. In keeping with theatrical tradition, DeMille sought a more formal and stylized mode of acting from stars Geraldine Farrar and Wallace Reid - a technique he continued in his late historical films. Wilfred Buckland's art direction is outstanding, and DeMille's social comments are subtle but biting. The film also features a dramatic hand-colored climax utilizing the Handschiegl stencil-color process.\n\nThe film became a prototype for DeMille's later spectacles. His handling of the large battle scenes (with the aid of seventeen cameras and a small army of assistant directors, including William deMille, George Melford and Donald Crisp) was exceptional - equal to D.W. Griffith's work in The Birth of a Nation and Intolerance. The real strength of the picture, however, is found in the director's provocatively compelling images:\n\nAt Joan's trial by torture, officials the Church are clad in white hooded robes with black holes for eyes. DeMille frames his shot so that the top of Cauchon's mitre is out of frame, and he looks like a black-clad grand dragon of the invisible empire surrounded by Klansmen and hiding behind a crucifix rather than a bishop of the Church. The empty town square. An executioner drives a single horse cart piled with kindling to lay around the stake where Joan will meet her death. A lone dog is the only living thing, barking a futile protest. As Joan is led to the stake, the Bishop Cauchon seizes her ornate crucifix, and as the flames surround her, Eric Trent hands Joan a handmade cross of simple twigs that she carries to her death. Ultimately, in an effort to get more performances per day, the picture was drastically cut very early in the run. This DVD release offers DeMille's director's cut and the original hand-colored climax. William Furst's original 1916 score is performed by Christian Elliott at the J. Ross Reed Wurlitzer, Sexson Auditorium, Pasadena, California.\n\n",

He has been called the \"father of observational astronomy\", the \"father of modern physics\", and the \"father of science\". In this historical drama, Galileo is on the verge of uncovering some of the mysteries of the universe when he's interrupted by some of life's more mundane problems: money, an idle, unemployed brother (Tony Nardi) and a jealous rival (Louis del Grande). Fortunately, he finds support from an unexpected source, the pampered son of the powerful Medici family. Under Galileo's tutelage, Cosimo de Medici (Kenny Vadas) finds that in searching for the stars, one has to have his feet firmly on the ground. The stakes mount as Galileo and his young protege struggle for intellectual freedom while challenging the scientific authorities in Padova. The drama set in 1605 leads to intrigue while Galileo takes serious risks on the path to the invention of the first telescope.\n\nThis film is an Emmy Award Winner!\n\n",

    "title": "D.W. Griffith Volume 1 - Years of Discovery 1909 - 1913",
    "language": "English, Silent",
    "release_year": 1909,
    "synopsis": "For the five years between 1908 and 1913, D.W. Griffith directed some 450 films for the Biograph Company, delivering at a rate of two or three films per week. These films, one and two reels in length, are sometimes regarded as apprentice works, films in which Griffith borrowed, invented, and perfected the forms and techniques that he later used to such memorable effects in The Birth of a Nation (1915), Intolerance (1916), Way Down East (1920), Orphans of the Storm (1921), and Isn't Life Wonderful? (1924). But the Biographs were more than that.\n\nThe twenty-two films presented in this collector's version of D.W. Griffith Years Of Discovery: 1909-1913 are the centerpieces of that extraordinary group of films. Volume One includes such widely recognized masterworks as The Musketeers of Pig Alley and Corner in Wheat. But lesser-known social dramas like What Shall We Do With Our Old? and a comic gem called The Sunbeam are also included. They rank among the best in a collection of short films that helped shape cinematic narrative for two generations.\n\nPlots are simple and direct, and if the films are saturated with quasi-comic cliches and old-fashioned insensitivities, they also reveal an extraordinary dramatic talent of brilliant force. It is easy to see why the Griffith Biographs were so popular at the time. With an uncanny instinct for acting talent, Griffith assembled the foremost film ensemble of his day, including Lillian and Dorothy Gish, Mary Pickford, Mack Sennett, Lionel Barrymore, Henry Walthall, and Mae Marsh. Beyond that, the requirements of plot detail, the tight physical locale of interior sets (we never see more that three sides of any room), and the need to establish character immediately resulted in a kind of cinematic shorthand which gave these shorts terrific compression. The limitations of time and space also meant that people, places, and objects frequently took on extraordinary metaphoric power they gradually lost as movies got longer. Many of the Griffith Biographs rank with the finest movies he ever made; collectively, they provide an unparalleled record of American life at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nIncludes: Those Awful Hats The Sealed Room The Redman's View Corner in Wheat The Unchanging Sea In the Border States His Trust What Shall We Do with Our Old? For His Son The Sunbeam The Girl and Her Trust The Female of the Species One Is Business, The Other Crime An Unseen Enemy The Painted Lady The Musketeers of Pig Alley\n\n",

Stationed in Egypt with the promise of grand adventure, all they seem to manage is casual mischief in the Cairo nightclubs.\n\nBut when German-backed Turkish forces attack British outposts in the Sinai desert, the soldiers climb into the saddle as mounted troops of the Australian Light Horse, participating in a fierce battle at Romani and on to Gaza. With fellow soldiers falling to the enemy, Red and his colleagues must overcome the odds and find the courage to contemplate one final charge - a deadly assault across open ground to Beersheba.\n\nA masterful achievement of sight and sound, Chauvel staged the epic charge with 500 active members of the Light Horse and captured their dynamic assault with camera work by legendary cinematographers such as John Heyer, Tasman Higgins, Frank Hurley, Bert Nicholas and Damien Parer. Fully restored and presented in a brand new transfer, Forty Thousand Horsemen documents a most remarkable era of Australian wartime history.\n\n",

Exhausted and disenchanted, at the tail end of youth, with nothing to show for his years of struggle beyond an empty wallet and a tenacious speed habit, Unai struggles to remember why he got into rock and roll in the first place.\n\nThen he meets Mary, an impulsive Lower East Side artist who captivates him with a punk spirit he feels he has lost. He invites her to join his tour, but the enterprise quickly collapses into an all-too-familiar routine of chiseling club owners, shifty speed pushers, and rude patrons.

    "synopsis": "Cecil B. DeMille directed this risque all-star revue of decadence which must have been jaw-dropping in 1921 and which remains astonishing today, although for entirely different reasons.\n\nAnatol de Witt Spencer (Wallace Reid), as incredibly wealthy as he is naive, and his child-like bride, Vivian (Gloria Swanson), are on their honeymoon. At a posh speakeasy he spies his high school sweetheart, Emilie (Wanda Hawley), from Pompton Lakes, New Jersey (DeMille's own hometown), who is obviously the sex toy of flamboyant old Gordon Bronson (known on Wall Street as the Man of Iron, but here as the Man of Dough). To Vivian's dismay, idealistic Anatol decides to rescue the seductive Emilie, sets her up in an expensive apartment and gets her violin lessons, but she won't change her stripes and goes back to Bronson. The Spencers then try a second honeymoon, but they are no sooner settled into a simple country life than almost the same thing happens again, this time with the thieving wife (Agnes Ayres) of a self-righteous deacon (Monte Blue).\n\nNot only does DeMille show women smoking, drinking (during Prohibition), exposing body parts seldom seen on a movie screen, and frankly pursuing men who attract them; he also presents this debauchery with amazing visual flair. DeMille clearly meant The Affairs of Anatol to be as much a decorative feast. With design by Erte, elegant Spencers honeymoon in sets that look like the work of Aubrey Beardsley on stimulants; Satan Synne's cape and tiara look like an octopus made of pearls, and all this exoticism is enriched by many striking and unusual lighting effects.\n\nThis edition is digitally mastered from an elaborate original print featuring hand coloring, stencil coloring, and dozens of changes in color tint and tone, in itself a striking work of art. The Affairs of Anatol is presented at a visually correct projection speed (21 frames per second) with a digital stereo score compiled by Brian Benison from authentic silent cinema music.\n\n",

    "title": "The Divine Michelangelo Part 1The Divine Michelangelo",
    "language": "English",
    "release_year": 2004,
    "synopsis": "Michelangelo's path to success was plagued with difficulties. This programme traces the troubled origins of his genius, from boyhood beatings from his father, to fights with fellow artists. His father's feeling that his obsession with art would bring disgrace to the family failed to deter the young, determined Michelangelo. Inspiration to become a sculptor came early, when his father sent him to a wet-nurse whose husband was a stonemason. By the time he reached his teens he showed precocious talent and at the age of 25 he was a rising star.\n\nThe tempestuous young Michelangelo made a name for himself as an art faker and his first major commission was rejected by his patron. One night, gripped by rage and driven by a determination to ensure the world knew who he was, he carved his name across the breast of his first masterpiece, the Pieta. Then, aged 26, he took on the seemingly impossible challenge of sculpting a colossal statue of the biblical hero, David, from one piece of flawed marble. The towering nude, over five metres tall, took more than two years to complete but established Michelangelo as the greatest sculptor alive, immortalising him forever. The programme shows sculptor Romolo Burati as he re-creates key features of the David's face, conveying the sheer skill and craft embodied in Michelangelo's exquisite work. Having created this great masterpiece, Michelangelo's next challenge was to design a structure to transport the sculpture, which weighed several tons, across the uneven roads without the giant crashing to the ground.\n\nIt was no mean feat even by today's standards. To illustrate the technical skills that Michelangelo displayed, the programme enlists engineer Nick McLean to follow in Michelangelo's footsteps. Using illustrations and a diary entry from an eye witness, he develops a structure to shift the replica David through the cobbled Italian streets. It becomes clear that Michelangelo's commission to carve the David proved him to be not only a master sculptor, but also a thoroughly able engineer.\n\n",

One by one, they share their hopes, fears, triumphs and frailties -- keeping their faith even as a dramatic upheaval threatens the life of a man they all love.\n\nThe New York Times called it \"superbly realized.\" The Boston Herald praised the film as \"a powerhouse of drama, humor and heart.\"\n\n\"Drunks\" was the first film to offer an behind-the-scenes look at an Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step recovery meeting. It won the entertainment industry's Prism Award for its realistic depiction of alcoholism and substance abuse.\n\n",

For Rolf his world is falling apart. An operation could save the dog but would cost a lot of money - money Rolf obviously doesn't have. In his desperation he believes that his only chance is to try his luck at the race tracks, even though he knows nothing about betting. Horse-Schafer (Bernd Stempel) must help. His apartment is almost empty except for a dining table and a horse painting. But Rolf's friend from the past doesn't want to join him at the race tracks. Rolf almost oversleeps the race, but Schafer wakes him - he has changed his mind. At the horse racing track, everything seems to go according to plan. They win the first race, just as Schafer predicted. But then Horse-Schafer and Rolf lose their luck and gamble away the winnings. Still, even underdogs get their chance sometimes. On this evening, Rolf is sure that Piet will grow ancient...\n\n",

James feels like an outsider, but things begin to improve when he is selected as a principal choirboy for Handel's oratorio, \"The Messiah.\" In the course of events, James is befriended by the renowned composer, who suffers from a temporary lack of self-esteem. When the boy is falsely accused of wrongdoing, Handel (Leon Pownall) comes to his rescue. \"The Messiah's\" premiere brings Handel glory and restores him to his rightful place in the musical world.\n\nHandel, orginally German, later became a British baroque composer who spent the bulk of his career in London, becoming well known for his operas, oratorios, anthems, and organ concertos.\n\nThe film won the \"Oppenheim Gold Seal Award,\" and \"Best Movie\" from the Gemini Awards.\n\n",

    "title": "Cold Fear - Gay Life in Russia",
    "language": "English",
    "release_year": 2014,
    "synopsis": "Cold Fear: Gay Life in Russia is a hauntingly beautiful and powerful documentary that travels to the dark heart of Russia and gives an insight into the reality of life - particularly gay life - that's in stark contrast to the glitz of the Sochi winter Olympics. There is fear on all sides, with many Russians equating gay behaviour with semi-demonic practices. They believe homosexuality is a lifestyle choice and see it as a direct attack on family values, even as a poison that is corrupting society and weakening Russia. On the other side, many gay Russians live in fear of direct intimidation, persecution and violence - and even murder. This film gives ordinary Russians a voice as it exposes a world of widespread repression and extreme violence: a world of cold fear.\n\nCold Fear: Gay Life in Russia is a searingly honest BBC current affairs and politics documentary which takes a look at what it is like to be gay in Russia, and explores the fears and intimidation that gay people have to live with on a daily basis.\n\n",

It premiered at the Bolshoi Theatre.\n\nThe film portrayed a real historical event - the mutiny of the warship \"Prince Potemkin Tavrichesky\". Eisenstein was originally quoted to say that his film's action was one of a drama, but it was structured as a chronicle. This motion picture lauded as a masterpiece of the Soviet documentary cinema, although the film's acting element is obvious. The famous Odessa Steps, the pram with a baby, the insurgent sailors on the ship, the hand-painted banner over the battleship - these and many other sequences of the legendary motion picture were later used as film citations, were included in every film-directing textbook, and generated numerous parodies.\n\nThe film was sound-tracked in 1930. and was voted the best of 100 best films, by an international poll of critics in 1978 (conducted by the Italian publishing house \"A. Mondadori\", Milan).\n\n",

Joshua is the most vulnerable to the deportation law because he is under the age of five and therefore must be kept hidden otherwise he risks being seen by the immigration authorities, who regularly patrol the neighborhood. The film also explores the life of a young lady, Tina (Cabral), who arrives to start a new life in Israel.\n\nTransit examines what it means to be a family and what it means to be a stranger, within one's home and in a foreign land.\n\n",

Both parts were released in the Soviet Union in 1980 and are based on a novel, Peter I, written by Aleksey Tolstoy. The film was directed by Russian director Sergey Gerasimov. The movie is considered to be a classic of Russian historical cinema.\n\nWith no access to the sea, Russia suffers great losses in foreign trade. Peter tries to capture the Turkish fortress of Azov, but with no success: he can win only if he has a fleet. Peter's ukases provoke the Boyars' indignation. Europe looks in amazement: the Russian tsar begins to work at a Dutch shipyard learning the subtleties of shipbuilding. But his training is cut short. Peter has to return to Russia in order to brutally suppress the Streltsy rebellion organized by his sister Sophia.\n\n",

This playlist features one of Sherwin's major film works 'Messages' (1981-4) a meditation on childhood and language inspired by the work of Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget and Sherwin's experience of his own daughter's development.\n\nGuy Sherwin has been working with film since the early 1970s. His formative period was first as a painter, at Chelsea School of Art in the late 60s; then at the London Film-Makers Co-operative in the mid 70s where he developed my interest in the forms and structures of film. At the LFMC he helped run the workshop and gave instruction in the use of the 16mm printing and processing machines. His work has employed a range of approaches, often concurrently: b/w silent films (Short Film Series 1975-1998, Animal Studies 1998-2003), live performances with film (Paper Landscape 1975, Man with Mirror 1976), hand-made optical soundtracks (Cycles #3 1972/2003, Railings 1977), gallery installations (Three Trees 2003, Clock Screen 2007) and lyrical, part-autobiographical films. Over the last few years he has exhibited his work and performed at numerous galleries and festivals in Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Over 80 years after her death, Marie Curie remains by far the best known female scientist. In her lifetime, she became that rare thing: a celebrity scientist, attracting the attention of the news cameras and tabloid gossip. They were fascinated because she was the first woman to win the Nobel Prize and is still the only person to have won two Nobels in two different sciences. But while the bare bones of her scientific life, the obstacles she had to overcome, the years of painstaking research, and the penalty she ultimately paid for her discovery of radium have become one of the iconic stories of scientific heroism, there is another side to Marie Curie: her human story.\n\nThis multi-layered film reveals the real Marie Curie, an extraordinary woman who fell in love three times, had to survive the pain of loss, and the public humiliation of a doomed love affair. It is a riveting portrait of a tenacious mother and scientist, who opened the door on a whole new realm of physics, which she discovered and named: radioactivity.\n\n",

Over the next 200 years, their tiny business grew into a commercial titan. Using the letters and diaries of the men and women who were there, this documentary tells the story of the East India Company, which revolutionised the British lifestyle, sparked a new age of speculation and profit and by accident created one of the most powerful empires in history.\n\nYet inexorable rise ended in ignominy. Dogged by allegations of greed, corruption and corporate excess, by the 1770s the company's reputation was in tatters. Blamed for turning its back as millions died in the Bengal famine, and thrown into crisis by a credit crunch in Britain, the world's most powerful company had run out of cash, sparking a government intervention\n\n",

    "language": "English",
    "release_year": 2004,
    "synopsis": "The story of Michelangelo's titanic struggle to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, one of the artistic marvels of the world. Imagine the torture of painting an area the size of a football pitch, 20 metres off the ground. From 1508 to 1512, this is exactly what Michelangelo was forced to do by Pope Julius II, who commissioned him to paint the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Michelangelo viewed it as a trap set by his enemies in the Vatican and was horrified that he would have to stoop to what he considered the lowly and inferior craft of painting. What he really wanted to do was carve the Pope's tomb - a saga in itself, which would haunt him for years to come. As Michelangelo confronted the huge expanse of the ceiling, he quickly ran into huge difficulties and ended up destroying his own work.\n\nThis programme explores some of the main challenges he faced by recruiting two modern fresco artists - Fleur Kelly and Leo Stevenson - to produce at a church in Leyton, east London, their own version of the iconic scene where God creates Adam. After four years of struggle and disappointment, the Sistine Chapel ceiling was complete. But the Pope was dissatisfied with the heavenly creation and demanded changes, such as the addition of more gold and blue, as he felt it looked too poor. Michelangelo, made ill by his trials, was not amused. But 25 years later, he did return to the Sistine Chapel to paint the fresco of The Last Judgement on the altar wall. Having established his genius as a sculptor and painter, Michelangelo went on to completely change the Roman skyline with his architectural designs. He broke many of the accepted rules of architecture, creating terrifically original and beautiful work, culminating in the dome of St Peter's.\n\nHe was obsessed by this final project for the rest of his life. He saw it as a deeply spiritual task that would assure him a place in history and in heaven. In his later years, Michelangelo's poetry also blossomed. Struck by true love for a young Roman nobleman named Cavalieri, he was inspired to write some of his most moving verses. When Michelangelo died at the age of 88 he left a fortune, including 8,000 gold coins in a walnut chest by his bed and numerous farms in Tuscany. He lived a simple, frugal existence but was also the richest, and most famous, artist ever to have lived.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "The story of Howard Winstone is a compelling one. Howard became Featherweight Champion of the World at the age of 29 in 1968. What makes Howard's story quite remarkable is that as a young man he lost the tips of three fingers in an industrial accident of his home town of Merthyr Tydfil. The accident was so severe that he was unable to make a fist with his right hand, a devastating blow for anyone, but a blow made all the worse for one who's entire career demands the use of both hands. Howard was known for his right handed power back in his early day's so the day of the fateful accident was essentially the day Howard's boxing career came to an end. Well that's what everyone assumed accept Howard, who completely changed the way he boxed and went on remarkably to become Champion of Britain, Champion of Europe and Champion of the world!\n\nThere was far more to Howard than just his boxing career, in Howard there was an incredible burning passion, a passion to overcome all the odds, Howard Winstone was distilled with something quite remarkable, Howard Winstone was destined for greatness. And through incredible adversity he achieved not only his life-long ambition, and exceeded the hopes of an entire nation when in 1968 he was crowned Featherweight Champion of The World at his fourth and almost certainly his final attempt. The feature film Risen takes the audience on this incredible journey, from potential, to injury, from injury, to greatness. This multi award winning film will keep you riveted to your seat.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Mooz-lum is the story of a black family within the first large generation of Muslims born and raised in this country and the trials and tribulations faced while practicing Islamic faith in American Society. The story is told through the eyes of Tariq Mahdi, a young man born and raised in a Muslim household along with his younger sister Taqua by their father Hassan and mother Safiyah. Hassan is determined to send Tariq to an Islamic school to learn the Quran, which Safiyah strongly objects to. When Hassan's strict beliefs become too much for Safiyah's liberal nature, she decides that she wants a divorce. Little do Tariq and Taqua know, the terms of the divorce are Tariq is to live with their father and Taqua with their mother.\n\nAfter the divorce, Hassan fulfills his plans for Tariq and sends him off to an Islamic boarding school. Six years later, Tariq is a freshman in college living back in the area he grew up. Having been at the Islamic boarding school and under the strict environment laid out by his father, Tariq wants nothing to do with his Islamic past. Since the divorce, Taqua has not seen Tariq very often and their relationship has drifted apart. She decides to reach out to him and attempt to rebuild their once strong relationship. Upon reuniting, she realizes that Tariq's attitude about Islam has been heavily affected by his time at the school and with their father, so she tries to open him up to different ways of viewing his beliefs and incorporating his faith into society. Unknown to Tariq, his college experience is going to be beyond just academic enrichment.\n\nTaqua starts spending time with him on campus and opening him up to new experiences. His roommate, Hamza, is an Arab Muslim who also tries to reach out and connect with him but Tariq constantly tries to avoid him. He also has interactions with a professor who challenges the students to think broadly about religion and world views, but the professor has to deal with the political ramifications from the dean of the department who is constantly trying to hold him down. Just as Tariq begins to grow as a person and open up to new ideas about his faith, the attacks on the World Trade Center take place. Immediately, the view of Muslims in America changes and some people begin to act on their anti-Islamic feelings. At that moment, Tariq must make many critical decisions with his life, from dealing with a Muslim/Christian relationship he has with a young lady named Ayanna, trying to deal with the views of Islam that he knows while separating it from the ones created by 9/11, all while trying to protect Taqua from a dangerous situation on campus.\n\n",

The film provokes the viewer to reflect on how our society can deprive boys of wholeness.\n\nThrough formative events of a boy's life, we come to understand the ways in which men can become emotionally disconnected and alienated from their feminine side. The common dismissal that \"boys will be boys\" evolves into the chilling realization that boys frequently become angry, destructive and emotionally disabled men. The Smell of Burning Ants illustrates how boys are socialized by fear, power and shame.\n\nThe film is a catalyst for discussion and an opportunity to begin the process of healing the wounds of childhood.\n\nWinner of 23 awards.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Although LOCAL COLOR is usually credited as being a minimalist film through its foregoing of complicated set design, director Mark Rappaport has intentionally conducted a feeling of excess in its textual elements. A shifting interior monologue among the cast of eight complicates our perspective of how this film is meant to be felt: without a form of protagonist, we are meant to reevaluate all of the characters' actions when their intentions are laid bare.\n\nThe cast consists of a pair of twins, both named Andy, their respective lovers, an aging dentist and his wife, and two more women, each trying to break away from their fidelity with nightmares of murder and disappointment getting in the way. If this were not enough, there is simply too much plot, leaving an adequate summary to either be ineffective or impossible. There is a causal narrative, yes, but these events do not build in any form of act structure.\n\nThere is no feeling of climax or relief, simply a fleeting chain of conversations sometimes recalling past events in the film, yet sometimes interjected with a narrator adding an unscreened prologue or epilogue as if the current running time is not enough for Rappaport to throw information at us, completing his thought as postscript.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "\"Women are not in love with me but with the picture of me on the screen. I am merely the canvas upon which the women paint their dreams.\" - Rudolph Valentino, 1923\n\nWomen fainted in the aisles when The Sheik was released in 1921. The titled Lady Diana Mayo (Agnes Ayres) is carried into the desert by an Arab chieftan, Ahmed Ben Hassan (Valentino), who takes one look at her and wants her, right then and there. Filmed on the heels of women's suffrage, Lady Diana was presented as a strong-willed and intelligent character, but as for Ahmed - nobody had seen anything like Valentino's natural sex appeal on the screen before. His charismatic presence electrified audiences; his Sheik symbolized the forbidden allure of the exotic and forever secured Valentino's place in screen legend. From the lavish dressing of this production, Arabian wall tapestries, tunics, cassocks and garish jewelry became a fad in decoration and attire.\n\nParamount hustled its new sensation from one uninspired vehicle to another, and Valentino, by all accounts an intelligent and considerate person, finally expressed his displeasure by taking leave of the studio. Legally blocked by Paramount from making films for others, he and his wife, Natacha Rambova, embarked on a national dance tour sponsored by a beauty aid called Mineralava. It culminated in a beauty contest judged by Valentino.\n\nThe Son of The Sheik, a sequel to The Sheik, was designed to revive Valentino's career. As both parent and son, Rudy has two virile leading parts, showing how a son of the desert inherited the passions of the father. Although the production is on a modest scale compared to the original Sheik, Valentino's performance is far more accomplished, and there's a tongue-in-cheek quality which gives The Son a certain magic even today. Young Ahmed falls in love with Yasmin, a dancing girl (Vilma Banky), but he is captured and tortured by bandits. Believing Yasmin to be responsible, he escapes and plans his own form of revenge, although true love, of course, finally prevails.\n\nIn New York for the premiere of The Son of The Sheik, Valentino collapsed and died eight days later at the age of 31.\n\n",

The film begins with old timer, Dinny (some say he knows too much for an outsider) telling the story of the Kelly Gang to a visiting sketch artist.\n\nHis tale unfolds as Ned Kelly and Joe Byrne surprise the constabulary in the bar of the Glenrowan Hotel and Ned shoots a constable in the hand. The Glenrowan Affair includes the ambush at Eleven Mile Creek, the hold up at the Jerilderie Bank and the siege at the Glenrowan Hotel where Ned, dressed in a suit of homemade armour, taunts the 'traps' in a hail of gunfire before he is shot and captured.\n\n",

The resentful crowd's actions are directed by the strike committee. They make a decision not to work until the strikers' demands are met: raising wages, improving labor conditions. The working-class settlement is threatened with hunger. The strike committee calls for patience and fortitude. To provoke the crisis, the management uses local hooligans. Brought to the point of despair, the crowd goes out in the street, where they're confronted with the Cossacks.\n\nAwards\nSilver Medal at the Paris Fair\n\n",

It uses her revolutionary editing techniques to reveal her thoughts and recuperate her legacy in the history of cinema.\n\nWOMAN WITH AN EDITING BENCH is about sustaining creativity and fighting repression. In 1930s Russia, Dziga Vertov and Elizaveta Svilova make radical, groundbreaking films. Stalin, threatened by their innovations, wants his henchmen to suppress them. Vertov, unhappy and artistically constrained, is inept at working with the bureaucracy. Svilova knows how to work the system laterally and from behind the scenes - as all great editors do. She is also adept at working with Vertov's mind, understanding what he wants to say and how he wants to say it. Svilova's editing makes Vertov's genius possible. Vertov's eccentricity makes Svilova's editing genius indispensable.\n\n",

    "title": "King Lear - with Christopher PlummerShakespeare Uncovered",
    "language": "English",
    "release_year": 2014,
    "synopsis": "King Lear is universally acknowledged as one of Shakespeare's greatest tragic roles. Plummer has played the role under the direction of Sir Jonathan Miller (who, we discover, has directed it six times).\n\nLear was, in fact, a real English king, who lived 800 years before Christ. Shakespeare's premise of Lear dividing his kingdom among his daughters and, in the process, disinheriting his favorite is, for the most part, supposedly true. It is included in the Chronicles of English History, which Shakespeare often used as source material. The historic story has a happy ending, but Shakespeare gave his theatrical interpretation a dreadful denouement that has been shocking audiences for 400 years.\n\nIan McKellen and Simon Russell Beale share their insights into this often-difficult character. And Plummer examines what inspired Shakespeare to write a play about a kingdom divided - at a delicate moment when a new King (James) from Scotland was trying to create what has become the \"united kingdom.\"\n\nWe learn how the storm scenes might have been produced at Shakespeare's own theater, and how they represent the storm going on in Lear's mind. The pain he endures is so intense that Shakespeare's version of the story was soon rewritten with a happy ending; at the Globe, we see this alternate ending acted out. Then we return to the real play and its heart-breaking tragedy of old age. One of Shakespeare's later plays, its ending may reflect something of his own mature cynicism. The powers of good fail and the gods do not prevent the deaths of Lear and Cordelia. But Plummer finds that beneath the cosmic emptiness, the possibility of love survives.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Tol'able David is a magnificent film, carefully transferred from the best available elements, and starring the great Richard Barthelmess (Broken Blossoms) in the title role. This rural adaptation of the David and Goliath tale chronicles the hero's passage into adulthood as he confronts three crooks looking for trouble. When the story opens, David Kinemon, the youngest son of tenant farmers living in small-town West Virginia, yearns to be seen as an adult. His youthful antics, however, prevent his family from seeing him as such. As his mother often tells him, \"You're not quite a man yet - you're only tol'able.\" Over the course of this coming-of-age tale, the young David overcomes grief, poverty, heartache, and danger to prove he is no longer merely \"tol'able,\" but a man. Gladys Hulette is charming as Esther Hatburn, the pretty girl next door, and Ernest Torrence gives a tremendous performance as the malicious Luke Hatburn.\n\nEdmund Goulding (Grand Hotel) adapted Joseph Hergesheimer's short story for the screen. Shot on location in Virginia, director Henry King (Carousel) delivers a delightful gem from film?s early years. This edition has been mastered from a compilation of the best surviving footage in two 35mm prints and a 35mm duplicate negative and is presented at the visually correct speed. The musical score is compiled and conducted by Robert Israel, with a small orchestra of piano, violin, cello, flute, clarinet, trumpet, trombone, drums, banjo and harmonica such as might have been heard when this film was performed theatrically in the 1920's.\n\nIn 2007, Tol'able David was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\nContains a rare, bonus interview with director Henry King talking about his life, his films, and specifically his work on Tol'able David.\n\n",

Michael Wood recovers her story from a copy of a lost chronicle written in Mercia in her lifetime which, in the film, we hear read in Old English.\n\nOne of the great forgotten figures in British history, Aethelflaed led armies, built fortresses, campaigned against the Vikings and was a brilliant diplomat. Her fame spread across the British Isles, beloved by her warriors and her people she was known simply as 'the Lady of the Mercians'. Without her, concludes Wood, 'England might never have happened'.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Founded in 1850, Lehman Brothers was one of Wall Street's oldest investment banks, but in September 2008, having taken a heavy blow from the sub prime mortgage crisis enveloping the US, it was on the brink of collapse. This film joins the story on Friday 12 September as the CEOs of Wall Street's leading investment houses and commercial banks are briefed on the Lehman situation. The US Treasury will not intervene - the only hope of controlling the chaos that would ensue if Lehman collapsed lies with the banks themselves. But all those present know that, due to the interconnected nature of 21st century banking, chaos for one financial institution means chaos for all... Inspired by the events of those three days, this drama follows the major players as they race against the clock to put together a rescue package for the failing bank and shows how they all have something to gain or lose during the long weekend's negotiation. The Last Days of Lehman Brothers tells the story of the most dramatic weekend on Wall Street since 1929 and a moment in time that will live on in history.\n\n",

After Solax ceased production, she became a director for hire and went to work for The International Film Service, owned by William Randolph Hearst. The plot of The Ocean Waif adheres closely to the Hearst agenda: a romantic story, plenty of pathos but no brutality, a likeable hero and an innocent young woman, and a suspenseful plot with a dramatic and happy ending (\"the Mary Pickford school of narrative\"). Blache's parody of the Pygmalion-type love story gives equal screen time to each lover's point of view, but also skewers conventional class tropes. Doris Kenyon stars in the title role of an abused young woman who finds safety and eventually love in the arms of a famous novelist.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Astonishingly, David Harewood was the first black actor to play the great Moorish Venetian general Othello at London's National Theatre, triumphantly taking on the role--but not until 1997. Now he returns to the play to discover how the centuries have changed our views of it.\n\nHarewood learns about the Moorish ambassador who visited the court of Queen Elizabeth I and may have inspired Shakespeare. He meets the National Theatre's latest Othello, Adrian Lester, who has also starred in a play about Ira Aldridge, the 19th-century American actor who was the first black man ever to play the role in England; the reviews were shockingly racist. And he watches different Othellos on film, including Laurence Olivier's acclaimed if controversial \"blacked-up\" version from the 1960s.\n\nOthello is actually a play dominated not by race, but by love and a great villain - Iago. A forensic psychiatrist helps to analyze this extraordinary psychopath and how he manipulates Othello by persuading him that his young wife is having an affair. Harewood meets Simon Russell Beale, who played Iago to his Othello, and they re-examine the lethal relationship. Imogen Stubbs and Sir Ian McKellen, who starred in Trevor Nunn's production; Julia Stiles, whose movie O was a modern take on the play; and Sir Patrick Stewart, who played Othello in a \"color-reversed\" production, also reflect on their characters.\n\n",

Her style of soulful pop transcended the US East Coast jazz clubs to become the dinner party sound track for Middle America. But behind this seemingly effortless career rise lies a much deeper, more substantial journey. Born into humble circumstances in America's segregated South, Roberta was a self-created musical prodigy who was one of the first and most significant black artists to cross over into the mainstream. This film follows Roberta's journey from her childhood in Arlington, Virginia in the 1930s and 40s, to the jazz clubs of Washington D.C. where Roberta honed her style, to the moment she signed up with Atlantic Records and became a multi-Grammy Award-winning star. It is a deeply personal story told alongside the wider context of America's civil rights movement, a struggle that was to strike a chord all over the world.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "From 1913 to 1916, Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle rose from the ranks of bit player to writer, director and star of comedies for Mack Sennett's Keystone Film Company. Because of Sennett's belief that actors were interchangeable, he lost Arbuckle to producer Joseph M. Schenck, who not only paid the comedian handsomely, but also permitted him complete creative control. To help in the new venture, Arbuckle recruited Buster Keaton, popular star of a knockabout vaudeville act; Keaton took a large pay cut to act in motion pictures, and Arbuckle welcomed his ideas and taught him all he knew about making movies. This volume of the collection presents films that Arbuckle and Keaton made for Schenck between 1918 and 1919; they are presented chronologically so we can watch Buster grow from Arbuckle's bit player to his full partner.\n\nFollowing the 1921 scandal that was inflamed by a publicity-seeking prosecutor and the tabloid press, Arbuckle's films were withdrawn from circulation in America, and the negatives were not preserved. The films in this collection were gathered from international archives and private collections. The English intertitles are new, and except for Back Stage, derived from non-English sources. All the films are digitally mastered from 35mm, sometimes directly from the nitrate originals.\n\n",

Porter and other early filmmakers used bizarre sets, fantastic costumes, and magic lantern tricks to illuminate their fantasy films. American parody supplied Douglas Fairbanks with enough unusual material to produce the truly surreal When the Clouds Roll By (1919). An expressionistic The Cabinet of Dr. Calagari (1919) influenced American sensibilities throughout the '20s as seen in Beggar of Horseback (1925), The Life and Death of 9413-A Hollywood Extra (1927) and The Telltale Heart (1928). The emphasis shifted when amateurs J.S. Watson, Jr., Joseph Cornell, and Orson Welles crafted a unique variety of American surrealism on film unfettered by European concerns.\n\n15 FILMS BY FEATURED DIRECTORS: G.W. \"Billy\" Bitzer, Joseph Cornell, James Cruze, Douglas Fairbanks, Victor Fleming, Robert Florey, Charles Klein, William Cameron Menzies, Edwin S.

Through a series of twenty-six short stories, a young girl chronicles the childhood events that shaped her ideas about fatherhood, family relations, work and play. As the stories unfold, a dual portrait emerges: that of a father who cared more for his career than for his family, and of a daughter who was deeply affected by his behavior. Working in counterpoint to the forceful text are sensual black and white images that depict both the extraordinary and ordinary events of daily life.

    "synopsis": "In 1918 and 1919, D.W. Griffith turned from spectacles such as The Birth of a Nation, Intolerance and Hearts of the World to smaller films, which he called his \"short story series.\" Among these is True Heart Susie (June 1919). \"There are those of us who consider True Heart Susie to be the Griffith's masterpiece,\" writes Tom Gunning in his notes for a 2006 screening at the Pordenone Silent Film Festival. He goes on to praise the \"narrative structure and point of view, as well as the fine details of performance, framing and even the use of inter titles, which make a seemingly modest film such as this appear nearly incandescent in its confessional and emotional power.\"\n\nIn an almost mythical American arcadia, Lillian Gish portrays a pure, prim girl who so loves her childhood sweetheart (Griffith's most charming boyish hero, Robert Harron) that she sells the family cow to anonymously finance his higher education, only to lose him to a more \"modern\" woman (Clarine Seymour) when he comes home. Miss Gish's performance is among her best, her face is what Gunning calls a \"battleground of emotions, staging complete and progressive dramas of realization, recognition and despair.\"\n\nAs a bonus feature, we offer Hoodoo Ann (February 1916). This light comedy is Griffith-supervised and scripted (using the pseudonym Granville Warwick), although the actual direction is by Lloyd Ingraham. Although the plot is a tangle of unlikely coincidence, the performers make it work, and \"it is filled with those little touches for which Fine Arts Pictures are famous,\" in the words of an original review.\n\nRodney Sauer compiled the music for both films; the score for True Heart Susie is performed by the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra. True Heart Susie was prepared in cooperation with the British Film Institute. James White of BFI Films supervised the digital mastering from BFI's 35mm duplicate negative, recreating the original tinting according to BFI's unique original print. Image quality and condition of the film is generally excellent. Hoodoo Ann is digitally mastered from a 35mm fine-grain master positive made from the camera negative. Both films are speed-corrected to appropriate frame rates. A minister marries an unfaithful flirt. When his wife dies, he turns to the girl who has always loved him. D.W. Griffith is in top form and Lillian Gish's performance is one of her best.\n\n",

The film follows the artist herself onto a phantasmagoric journey through the universe echoing Stanley Kubrick's thematic concerns for human evolution, progress and technology. However, in her film, Sansour posits the idea of a first Palestinian into space, and, referencing Armstrong's moon landing, she interprets this theoretical gesture as \"a small step for a Palestinian, a giant leap for mankind\".\n\n",

Sideways, minus the profound antipathy toward Merlot.\n\nOn the first day of shooting, Shields and Powell throw out the script when a real-life, real-time argument erupts, with Powell threatening to storm off the set and shut down the movie over what can and can't be used. Franco is unwillingly dragged into the scene to mediate the quarrel and, ultimately, help to save the film.\n\nVery loosely adapted from the widely acclaimed book of the same name (\"Outrageously entertaining\"--Boston Globe), I Think You're Totally Wrong is a thrilling and hilarious debate about what matters more, life or art.

    "release_year": 2014,
    "synopsis": "Fiennes has a unique perspective on Romeo and Juliet. He played Shakespeare - both writing and performing as Romeo - in the film Shakespeare in Love. Now he wants to examine why it remains the most-performed of all Shakespeare plays.\n\nFiennes takes us back to the source - an Italian story translated into English when Shakespeare was a boy. Shakespeare adapted and dramatized the Italian poem, and other writers have been adapting him for centuries ever since. At London's Royal Ballet, viewers see the play in a famous dance interpretation, and later Stephen Sondheim discusses adapting for the Broadway musical theater as West Side Story. Fiennes visits adult night classes at a South London school where the participants can see their own lives reflected in the play.\n\nOrlando Bloom and Condola Rashad, who recently played the immortal lovers on Broadway in 2013, discuss the continuing power of the play and its poetry. And Fiennes looks at noted film adaptations, ranging from Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 Italian masterpiece to Baz Luhrman's contemporary re-imagining. We attend the premiere of a new film adaptation, this time rewritten by Julian Fellowes. Back at the Globe, we watch as the company rehearses a scene with a young man very effectively playing Juliet - just as would have been done in Shakespeare's time.\n\nThe ending of this play is so tragic that for years rewritten versions dominated the stage. Yet Fiennes sees a more hopeful message coming from the tragic ending, one about the eternal power of love.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "A young man sets out to understand why his brother has fundamentally changed his life and beliefs, filming their encounters over 12 months to discover more about the world he has chosen. Like himself, Robb Leech's step-brother Rich was an ordinary white middle-class boy from an English seaside town and, until a couple of years ago, they were almost inseparable. But then Rich moved away, and the family learned via a press story that he'd become a radical Islamist, changing his name to Salahuddin. Associating with jihadist fundamentalists, he believes the UK should be ruled by Sharia law. Over the course of the film, Robb attempts to reconnect with his extremist step-brother, to discover what's made the person he'd looked up to as a teenage role model so strongly reject all that his family and the Western world stand for.\n\n",

    "language": "English",
    "release_year": 1995,
    "synopsis": "This is a film about Johann Strauss Jr., an Austrian composer of light music, particularly dance music and operettas. He composed over 500 waltzes, polkas, quadrilles, and other types of dance music, as well as several operettas and a ballet. In his lifetime, he was known as \"The Waltz King\", and was largely responsible for the popularity of the waltz in Vienna during the 19th century. Inspired by \"Tales from The Vienna Woods,\" \"The Blue Danube,\" \"Vienna Blood,\" \"Roses from the South\" and \"Perpetual Motion,\" the city of Vienna was alive with music. But, all is not well with Johann Strauss Jr. (Michael Riley). He may be the toast of waltzing Vienna, but he is haunted by the constant pressure to outdo himself with each new composition and also by the memory of his late father, who, though a musician himself, disapproved of his son's musical ambitions. Nicholas (Derek Senft), a humble stable boy at the estate where Strauss takes refuge, has even more pressing concerns. He's fearful of his brutal stepfather and feels he has nowhere to turn for help. To their surprise, the composer and the boy find in one another solace from their trials and discover the healing bond of trust. Together they embark on a collaboration that will be music to the world's ears.\n\nWinner of the \"Seal of Quality\" from the Family Channel.\n\n",

Clear about what is not appropriate for her, she is searching for what is: a choice. She takes a job at an inner-city hair salon and a room in a nearby boarding house. Here she meets Gaye, who lives on love and spurts on her asthma inhaler. Through a quirk of fate she meets Rex (Nique Needles) in the hall with not much on but the imprint of a boot on his behind. She takes him in, captivated by his smile. They warm to one another at once. Rex appreciates Mitchell's style and is impossible to ignore.\n\nThe drawback is he comes fully loaded: Mitchell discovers that where Rex is trouble follows close behind. He is not so much a criminal as he is loyal to his off-beat mates - he is unable to say no. His pride forbids him to turn down a mate; he goes from one favour to the next, and he loses out every time. He hopes his late-night vigils and bounty of gifts will keep Mitchell agreeable. What he knows about love, romance and caring he has borrowed from pop songs, bubble-gum wrappers, tattoos and bus shelters. When Rex is arrested, after one favour too many, he and Mitch are forced to re-evaluate their relationship and take their bearings.\n\nMary Callaghan's first feature is an edgy inner-city romance full of unexpected pleasures and featuring a marvellous central performance by Jo Kennedy.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "This historical drama is about Claude Monet, a founder of French Impressionist painting and the most consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement's philosophy. The film begins in 1869 in a small town on the banks of the Seine outside Paris. There Monet (Stuart Hughes) experiments with his revolutionary new painting style. With his friend Pierre-Auguste Renoir (Richard Clarkin) he spends endless days perfecting canvasses that are shimmering reflections of local landscapes. Monet has little success selling his works, but he is proud and committed to his art. The son of Monet's landlady, Daniel (Trevor Blumas), befriends Monet who becomes both a mentor and father-figure. Daniel's mother (Maggie Huculak) is dismayed when Monet is late on his rent and then also finds out that Daniel is skipping school to accompany Monet on his painting excursions. She evicts him from the inn with great fanfare. Eventually all is made well when Daniel's mother discovers that Daniel has learned the truth that his father abandoned them, and that Monet is the only one who Daniel will speak to. Though they both feel like giving up, together they find the strength to make it through the difficult times. In doing so, they teach each other the importance of holding on to goals and dreams.\n\nThe film won the \"Top 5 of the Year Award\" from KidsFirst!\n\n",

Exploring its devastating impact on lives, careers and relationships, Charlie Elmore highlights how society treats young adults who are dealing with its wide-ranging and not always obvious symptoms. The winter sports instructor was injured in a snowboarding accident and, after being helicoptered to hospital and placed in an induced coma, spent months in rehabilitation. She made an amazing recovery - even getting back on a snowboard a year later - but she's still coming to terms with how her brain has changed and knows that not everyone is lucky enough to get the right treatment. This compelling documentary follows Charlie as she retraces the steps of her rehabilitation and meets three other young people recovering from recent brain injuries. Together, they embark on a mission to improve our understanding, prevention and treatment of this life-changing disability.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "This short drama speaks about the conflict between the Indigenous people of the Perth area and colonial culture. A drama about two Indigenous men - Frank (Bruce Hutchison) and Vinnie (Kelton Pell) - who seek revenge for the repeated beheading of the statue of their ancestor warrior Yagan. They are modern day head hunters who have been on an Australia-wide rampage, taking trophies from every state in a seemingly erratic way. But there is method in their madness. They don't just want any heads - they want famous heads, heads of value and heads that will stop the nation in its tracks. When the police finally capture 'The Dutchman' by default, we hear ... Confessions of a Headhunter.\n\nBased on the short story of the same name written by Archie Weller, Confessions of a Headhunter is a film that speaks about the conflict between Indigenous people or Noongar of the Perth area, and colonial culture. The symbolic violence that is the artefact of an actual war that took place - and as the film suggests - is still taking place, is represented here by the Indigenous characters, who retaliate to the disrespect shown to their ancestor warrior Yagan, an important part of Noongar heritage and culture.\n\nYagan, a member of the Whadjuk Noongar people and believed to have been born around 1795, was a warrior who resisted the colonisation of Perth. The real Yagan's head was smoked and sent to England as a trophy, where it was on display in Liverpool until 1964 as an 'anthropological curiosity'. In 1993 Yagan's remains were repatriated, but remain unburied due to a disagreement between the Indigenous people of the Perth area over issues of proper burial.\n\nWeller was inspired to write the short story after the statue of Yagan itself was beheaded twice. Sally Riley and Archie Weller's adaptation won the script category of the 2001 Western Australian Premier's Book Awards, and was the winner of the Cinema Nova Award and the 2000 Australian Film Institute Awards for Best Short Fiction Film.\n\nDirected by Sally Riley. Produced by Kath Shelper. Screenplay: Sally Riley and Archie Weller.\n\n",

It focuses on a temperamental, demanding composer and a free-thinking servant boy, both of whom feel like prisoners of circumstance.\n\nThe last thing Frederick (Kyle Labine) wants to be when he grows up is a servant like his mother (Rosemary Dunsmore) and father (Ian D. Clark), who labor for the Duke at his castle in Weimar. Frederick aspires to be a stonemason. Meanwhile, Johann Sebastian Bach (Ted Dykstra) is terribly frustrated by being pigeonholed as the court organist. He wants to be allowed to compose and perform the glorious music that springs forth irrepressibly in his mind. After Frederick is ordered to become Bach's assistant, Bach is jailed for insubordination. Both of their futures seem bleak. Eventually after a key turn of events, they both come to understand the importance of developed genius when opportunity knocks.\n\nThe film won the \"Oppenheim Gold Seal Award,\" \"Best Program of the Year\" from Parent Magazine, and \"Best Children's Program\" from KidsFirst!\n\n\"Oppenheim Gold Seal Award\"\n\"Best Program of the Year\" -Parent Magazine\n\"Best Children's Program\" -KidsFirst!\n\n",

This great genius of the Italian Renaissance, Leonardo Da Vinci, is already a highly regarded painter, but his keen mind, acute powers of observation, and his insatiable curiosity lead him restlessly to also unlock the mysteries of nature. Together, in this historical drama, Roberto and Leonardo study winged creatures and turn their dreams to the conquest of the skies. Inspired by Leonardo, Roberto allows his imagination to soar. If others of the earth's creatures can fly, why not man?\n\nThis film won \"Best Movie\" from the Gemini Awards.\n\n",

Bizet (Maurice Godin) is a man of many passions for his family, his artist friends and, most of all, for his music. But each of them is prey to doubts. Michelle wonders if her soldier father will ever return from Spain. Bizet hopes he can rise to the challenge of finishing Carmen, the opera that haunts him. Together, Michelle and Bizet learn that dreams come true only when the time is right and even then in the most surprising ways.\n\n\"Best Drama\" -ACTA\n\"Best Children's Program\" -Parenting Magazine\n\"Monitor Award\"\n\n",

But the intricately interconnecting relationships glimpsed in mosaic-like shards here exist in a similarly embattled milieu, an urban war zone: war between the sexes (or perhaps between the urges toward and against any kind of intimacy).\n\nWith Tin Pan Alley standard \"Taking a Chance on Love\" as ironic theme song, Rappaport's characters reach out to one another but might get their hand bitten off as thanks. Among them are a Vietnam vet (Mark Arnott) with paranoid hallucinations; an emasculating ex-soap opera actress (Marilyn Jones) whose tender side comes out only when she sees herself in TV reruns; a gay man (Reed Birney) whose involvement with a straight hustler proves more than either of them can handle.\n\nAs is this singular writer-director's way, the drama is elliptical, the comedy slyly in-jokey and the narrative can run any which way, encompassing a lecture on sharks, campy medical horror, double-team prostitutes and yes, actual chain letters.\n\nNominated for the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\n",

What we build, what we destroy, what we find useful to do both, how we let our interaction with them describe what we call human - these are some of the ideas Angerame's Deconstruction Sight suggests.\" - From an essay by Barbara Jaspersen Voorhees, 1990\n\n\"...the images of Continuum certainly haunt me: there was the softest continual casualness of editing (beseeming \"casualness\", I should say; for I certainly DO know how difficult this is to accomplish), and a steadiness-of rhythm, always moving/moving but never as anything ominous to me, or inexorable something more like very heavy water lapping. Then the blacks and whites, evolving from some gray \"cloud\" into the stark sharp glistens of \"stars\" in the deep black of \"tar\" for the \"tar\" too seemed more night that what you'd photographed. It was amazing to me how little evidence there was in the film of the Time in which it was made, or even the location: I found myself tending to forget that these were City-chores, that this was rooftop work, so forth: just the labor, the continuity of labor, timeless, and ongoing, without inexorable.

With a booming economy and massive social changes, there is a swagger to this once-sleeping giant, but what do we know of it apart from football and carnival? Michael Palin has travelled across most of the globe over the years, but never to Brazil. In this four-part series he crosses the country as big as a continent to find out what makes it tick.\n\nHe begins his journey in the north east, where modern Brazil was born. It was here the Portuguese explorers first landed and encountered the native Brazilians. It was here that hundreds of thousands of African slaves were brought to work on sugar and tobacco plantations, and it was here where this mix of races and cultures produced what we now think of as Brazil. Music, food, dance, religion - all of these bear the imprint of this heady mix.\n\nHe starts in the city of Sao Luis during the celebration of its own very north eastern festival of Bumba Meu Boi - 'Jump My Bull' - before travelling down the coast to Recife and Salvador. On his way, he drops in on the vaqueros - Brazilian cowboys - who work the massive cattle ranches of the dry interior. His travels also take him to the stunning coastal lagoons of the Lencois Maranheses national park.\n\nIn Salvador he learns to drum with the famous Olodum school, experiences the trance and dance of Candomble, the Afro-Brazilian religion, finds out how to cook Bahian-style with renowned cook, Dada, and discovers what lies behind the beguiling moves of capoeria dancers. If you want to know what makes Brazil so vibrant, the north east is the place to start.\n\n",

Soon after his arrival in Australia in 1952 as a migrant from Italy, he began making films at a time when feature film production in Australia was almost non-existent.\n\nHis films were seldom seen in Australia, although one - CLAY (1965) - was applauded overseas as an official selection in the Cannes Film Festival. They have been virtually unavailable since. All of these films reveal Mangiamele's keen eye for visual poetry and the strong humanism of his concern for his characters. These qualities are amplified in his first completed feature film, CLAY, which explores the alienation, not of migrants, but of a man on the run from the police who is taken in by an isolated community of artists.\n\nHis emerging love affair with a young sculptor leads to tragedy. The intensity of Mangiamele's breathtaking vision recalls the work of Jean Cocteau and other French romantic poet/filmmakers, and signifies the appearance of a major art cinema talent, imbued with European cinema culture, who tragically never found an opportunity to find full expression of his vision after this one extraordinary feature.\n\n",

The sole surviving print was found in France in 2006; the English titles are restored according to the original script. A gap in the recovered footage is bridged with stills, titles, and footage from the original trailer so the story is complete; the Mont Alto Motion Picture Orchestra provides a lovely score of period photoplay music.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "A series of films about how humans have been colonised by the machines they have built. Although we don't realise it, the way we see everything in the world today is through the eyes of the computers.\n\nThis is the story of the dream that rose up in the 1990s that computers could create a new kind of stable world. They would bring about a new kind global capitalism free of all risk and without the boom and bust of the past. They would also abolish political power and create a new kind of democracy through the internet where millions of individuals would be connected as nodes in cybernetic systems - without hierarchy.\n\nThe film tells the story of two perfect worlds. One is the small group of disciples around the novelist Ayn Rand in the 1950s. They saw themselves as a prototype for a future society where everyone could follow their own selfish desires. The other is the global utopia that digital entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley set out to create in the 1990s. Many of them were also disciples of Ayn Rand. They believed that the new computer networks would allow the creation of a society where everyone could follow their own desires, yet there would not be anarchy. They were joined by Alan Greenspan who had also been a disciple of Ayn Rand. He became convinced that the computers were creating a new kind of stable capitalism - \"Like a New Planet\", he said.\n\nBut the dream of stability in both worlds would be torn apart by the two dynamic human forces - love and power.\n\n",

Ostracized from the trading post, he escapes to the hills after brawling with the trader who cheated him. In 1920 he becomes a Soviet partisan, and helps the partisans fight for the Soviets against the occupying British army. However he is captured by the British when they try to requisition cattle from the herdsmen at the same time as the commandant meets with a reincarnated Grand Lama. After the trapper is shot, the army discovers an amulet that suggests he is a direct descendant of Genghis Khan. They find him still alive, so the army restores his health and plans to use him as the head of a puppet regime. The trapper is thus thrust into prominence as he is placed in charge of the puppet government. By the end, however, the \"puppet\" turns against his masters in an outburst of fury.\n\n",

Set in 1874, Homer (Wayne Best) had seen and recorded many of the horrors of the Civil War. Leaving the battlefield and his post as illustrator for Harpers' Weekly behind, he returns to Houghton Farm to be alone, refocus and paint. Breathing in the fresh air, he sets up his easel at the nearby river. A truant boy, Gabe (Ryan Deboer), fires his slingshot directly at Homer, sending brushes and paints floating downstream. Gabe is joined by a girl named Fee (Tamara Hope) and both of them are so fascinated with Homer and his art, he has no choice but to show them his studio. Since he can't get rid of them, Homer asks them to be his models. As they pose, Gabe and Fee become fast friends. A rift between the children leaves Homer at a loss to complete the paintings he's started, so he does his best to bring them together. Through sharing their feelings, to escape the fear and shadows of the Civil War, all three discover that the present has more to offer than the ghosts of the past.\n\nThe film won the \"ALA Notable Video Award,\" and the \"Top 5 of the Year Award\" from KidsFirst!\n\n",

As anatomists used dissections to discover the truth about the human body, illustrators worked with them to create anatomically accurate drawings to be used as a teaching tool for medical students and surgeons. Anatomical art also found its way into galleries visited by art patrons in Rembrandt's Amsterdam. We follow the demand for first hand experience from Galen and Vesalius as anatomists leave behind the classical ideal and seek more accurate depictions of what they saw.\n\n",

In a convent boarding school in Alice Springs, she is misunderstood and bullied by a severe, unloving nun. She escapes in dreams and eventually in reality to her mother living in a camp, where she feels at peace.\n\nAs an exploration of Aboriginal identity, the film makes a strong contribution, evoking the subjective feelings of someone whose sense of identity is more powerful than the mere surface of her white skin and her blonde hair.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "A series of films exploring the idea that we have been colonised by the machines we have built. Although we don't realise it, the way we see everything in the world today is through the eyes of the computers.\n\nThis is the story of how our modern scientific idea of nature, the self-regulating ecosystem, is actually a machine fantasy. It has little to do with the real complexity of nature. It is based on cybernetic ideas that were projected on to nature in the 1950s by ambitious scientists. A static machine theory of order that sees humans, and everything else on the planet, as components - cogs - in a system.\n\nBut in an age disillusioned with politics, the self-regulating ecosystem has become the model for utopian ideas of human 'self-organizing networks' - dreams of new ways of organising societies without leaders, as in the Facebook and Twitter revolutions, and in global visions of connectivity like the Gaia theory.\n\nThis powerful idea emerged out of the hippie communes in America in the 1960s, and from counterculture computer scientists who believed that global webs of computers could liberate the world.\n\nBut, at the very moment this was happening, the science of ecology discovered that the theory of the self-regulating ecosystem wasn't true. Instead they found that nature was really dynamic and constantly changing in unpredictable ways. But the dream of the self-organizing network had by now captured our imaginations - because it offered an alternative to the dangerous and discredited ideas of politics.\n\n",

Doctors at Oxford's John Radcliffe Hospital can operate but the surgery carries a high risk of paralysis. At the hospital's Obstetrics Department, a pregnant mother faces a comparable issue. Her unborn baby has serious spinabifida - and now an ultrasound scan shows what might be a tumour on his back. She must decide whether to continue with the pregnancy.\n\nPatients like these often become 'frequent-flyer' cases for brain surgeons like Jay Jayamohan. 'You know when you take these kids on they're going to be with you for your entire life', says Jay. We meet 19-year-old Jack, who Jay has been treating for eight years. Jack was born with Crouzon syndrome, a serious genetic abnormality which affects every cell in his body. He has had, so far, 27 operations. We meet him during yet another hospital stay - this time for 11 weeks - as Jay and his colleagues battle to control a leak of cerebral fluid from the back of Jack's head.\n\nIn this series, we see the dramatic and cutting edge brain surgery performed by Jay and his colleagues in Oxford and we see the personal cost to the patients and doctors who have to make often agonising decisions.\n\n",

He and Fiennes meet up again to try to untangle the extraordinary plot of one of Shakespeare's most enduringly popular plays, a great comedy of love and enchantment.\n\nBonneville goes to see the play - on Midsummer's Night - at the Globe Theatre and talks to the Globe's Artistic Director Dominic Dromgoole about its delicate balance between comedy and tragedy, the natural and the supernatural. It is thought the play might have been performed as part of a wedding celebration, and the Globe actors try some of the scenes in the stately ruins of Copped Hall right next to the site of the original structure which may have been the play's original performance venue.\n\nAt one point of the Dream, Shakespeare has fun with his own great romantic tragedy. The play's final scene, in which Bottom and his fellow mechanicals perform a dreadfully bad version of a Romeo & Juliet-like story, is one of the best-loved scenes in all of Shakespeare. Hugh meets up with actor David Walliams, who is about to play Bottom, and looks back on James Cagney's performance in the 1935 film.\n\nWe see clips from the landmark Peter Brook production and the BBC's 1980 production with Helen Mirren as Titania, and hear from director Julie Taymor, who recently staged a vivid production at the Theater for a New Audience in Brooklyn (starring David Harewood). In the deserted Globe Theatre, Bonneville muses on the play's enduring appeal.\n\n",

    "language": "English",
    "release_year": 2009,
    "synopsis": "Can Darwin and religion exist side by side? Did Darwin Kill God? is a thought-provoking programme where Anglican Christian, philosopher and theologian Conor Cunningham explains why these two beliefs are not in conflict.\n\nRichard Dawkins, famous for his book The God Delusion, believes there is an irreconcilable clash between the theory of evolution and a belief in God. But Conor thinks Dawkins is mistaken. He uncovers traditional Christian thinking about the creation of life, reveals how Christians were never expected to read the creation account in Genesis literally and discovers that Creationism is a modern invention.\n\nCommunicating his passion for the subject with rich visual metaphors in Did Darwin Kill God? and making complex ideas accessible, Conor shows how Darwin's vision of the universe enhances our appreciation of a natural world that is full of wonder and stunning intelligibility - a vision of existence which neither leads to nor precludes either atheism or faith.\n\n",

    "title": "D.W. Griffith Volume 2 - Years of Discovery 1909 - 1913",
    "language": "English, Silent",
    "release_year": 1909,
    "synopsis": "For the five years between 1908 and 1913, D.W. Griffith directed some 450 films for the Biograph Company, delivering at a rate of two or three films per week. These films, one and two reels in length, are sometimes regarded as apprentice works, films in which Griffith borrowed, invented, and perfected the forms and techniques that he later used to such memorable effects in The Birth of a Nation (1915), Intolerance (1916), Way Down East (1920), Orphans of the Storm (1921), and Isn?t Life Wonderful? (1924). But the Biographs were more than that.\n\nThe twenty-two films presented in this collector's version of D.W. Griffith: Years Of Discovery: 1909-1913 are the centerpieces of that extraordinary group of films. Volume Two includes such widely recognized masterworks as The Battle at Elderbush Gulch and The New York Hat. But lesser-known social dramas like The House of Darkness. They rank among the best in a collection of short films that helped shape cinematic narrative for two generations.\n\nPlots are simple and direct, and if the films are saturated with quasi-comic cliches and old-fashioned insensitivities, they also reveal an extraordinary dramatic talent of brilliant force. It is easy to see why the Griffith Biographs were so popular at the time. With an uncanny instinct for acting talent, Griffith assembled the foremost film ensemble of his day, including Lillian and Dorothy Gish, Mary Pickford, Mack Sennett, Lionel Barrymore, Henry Walthall, and Mae Marsh. Beyond that, the requirements of plot detail, the tight physical locale of interior sets (we never see more that three sides of any room), and the need to establish character immediately resulted in a kind of cinematic shorthand which gave these shorts terrific compression. The limitations of time and space also meant that people, places, and objects frequently took on extraordinary metaphoric power they gradually lost as movies got longer. Many of the Griffith Biographs rank with the finest movies he ever made; collectively, they provide an unparalleled record of American life at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nIncludes: The New York Hat The Burglar?s Dilemma The House of Darkness Death?s Marathon The Mothering Heart The Battle at Elderbush Gulch\n\n",

Saddled with debt and struggling to survive, he derives unexpected inspiration from an aspiring young ballerina named Marie (Alison Pill). Degas helps Marie tap into the incredible talent she doesn't believe she has, especially when compared to her beautiful and confident sister Pauline (Kathryn Long) who is also a ballerina. At the same time, Marie convinces Degas to persevere in the face of relentless criticism from the Parisian art establishment. In the hours they spend together as artist and model, they become friends and confidantes, finding what they most need to move forward and follow their dreams.\n\nThis drama won the \"Editor's Choice Award\" from Booklist, \"The Humanitas Prize,\" the \"ALA Notable Video Award\" and the \"Top 5 of the Year Award\" from \"KidsFirst!\".\n\n",

    "synopsis": "This historical drama is about Thomas Edison, American inventor and businessman. He developed many devices that greatly influenced life around the world, including the phonograph, the motion picture camera, and the long-lasting, practical electric light bulb. This story is set in 1893, in Menlo Park, New Jersey, where Thomas Edison (Ken Walsh) - the world's greatest inventor - is alone in his lab, obsessed by a vision: \"What if I could do for the eye what my favorite invention, the phonograph, does for the ear?\" Edison's prototype, the 'Kinetoscope,\" is destroyed by Jack (Michal Suchanek), a scruffy twelve year-old, desperately fleeing an angry truant officer when he crashes into the Wizard's lab. Edison's first inclination is to throw the brat back to the wolves, but, because he recognizes something of himself in the boy, he covers for Jack and takes him in. Jack becomes a kind of Sorcerer's Apprentice to Edison, sharing the adventure, the late hours and the unrelenting energy of the \"Wizard of Menlo Park,\" as they pursue the dream of the idea of motion pictures.\n\nThis film is an Emmy Award Winner!\n\n",

The landing sequence was staged at Sydney's Tamarama Bay, as hundreds of soldiers from the Army's Liverpool Training Camp stormed the beach and scrambled up the cliffs. It is sobering to realise that many of these men were soon to leave Australia and join the fighting in Europe.\n\nThis version of The Hero of the Dardanelles was reconstructed by the NFSA and Australian historian Dr Daniel Reynaud. Despite missing significant sections of the film, the reconstruction uses surviving footage, documentary film, and newspaper stills to give a realistic impression of the original film.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Globally, billions are spent on coffee each year and the drink in its various forms is an essential part of life and culture for millions of people. But where does it all come from? Who grows and packs our coffee beans? Adventure journalist Simon Reeve embarks on a journey across Vietnam, which in just over 30 years has become the second largest coffee producer in the world. He discovers the impact the rapidly expanding coffee market has had on a nation of small farms. Simon begins his journey in Hanoi before heading into Vietnam's exotic highlands where, in the aftermath of the war with America, a vast coffee-growing programme was launched to help the country's economic recovery - but has led to widespread environmental damage.\n\n",

    "title": "The Super-Rich and Us Episode 1The Super-Rich and Us",
    "language": "English",
    "release_year": 2015,
    "synopsis": "In programme one of this two-part series, Jacques Peretti looks at how the super-rich first exploited an obscure legal loophole to make Britain one of the most attractive tax havens on earth. He argues this was no accident. Wooing the super-rich was a deliberate strategy by government to reconfigure the British economy, under the belief their wealth would trickle down to the rest of us. But it didn't. The OECD now say the British economy would have been 20 per cent bigger had we not pursued the super-rich. So who sold us the fallacy and why?\n\nJacques meets the super-rich themselves - from those buying premiership football clubs to the billionaires who are breaking ranks to criticise the decisions that made them richer and society more unequal.\n\nJacques challenges the architects of these policies, as well as tracking down the foreign multimillionaires who are buying up Britain and turning us from a nation of property owners to a nation of renters.\n\nHe uncovers new research that shows growing inequality has been driven by this key factor of unaffordable property, and the far-reaching effect this will have on every aspect of our lives. Inequality is reshaping Britain into two simple classes: the 99 per cent and the one per cent. This is the story of how it happened and what it means for all of us.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "By 1800 the East India Company had grown from a tiny band of merchants into a colossal trading empire. But scandal and corruption in the 18th century had led to a curtailment of its powers by the British government. The state now controlled the company's affairs in India and, throughout the 19th century, would chip away at its remaining powers and trading privileges.\n\nThe company was transformed from a trading enterprise into the rulers of India, and governed vast swathes of the subcontinent on behalf of the British Crown. Its territory expanded enormously and an empire was born.\n\nAs the company traded opium to a reluctant Chinese Empire, in India a dangerous chasm opened up between the British rulers and the Indian people. Alienated and disaffected, significant numbers of the company's massive army of Indian soldiers finally revolted and the Company's handling of the mutiny was its final undoing. In 1858 British India passed into Queen Victoria's hands and the Raj was born.\n\n",

Robby is leaving for a job in the opal fields of Coober Pedy. Feeling abandoned, Shane taunts him into drinking heavily and plots to find a way of stopping him from leaving. Awakening in a prison cell, the brothers attempt to reconstruct the events of the preceding night - a long night of self-destructive drinking. Gradually the pieces of the nightmare start falling into place, or do they?\n\nA story of disempowerment and the breaking of a spirit, COLD TURKEY provides a twist on the theme of \"brotherly love\". Superbly acted by its young cast, and inventively directed, this intense and unsettling drama offers an insight into the emotional dimension of social dislocation and alienation among young Aboriginal men in an urban context.\n\nThe film was nominated for two AFI Awards - for Best Screenplay and for Acting (John Moore) in the non-feature film category.

    "title": "Mozart In Love",
    "language": "English",
    "release_year": 1975,
    "synopsis": "Mark Rappaport's second feature film (amongst a remarkable string of off-beat, experimental narratives that runs from CASUAL RELATIONS to CHAIN LETTERS) takes off from the deliberate anachronism of using modern props, performance styles and attitudes to evoke the romantic entanglements of the young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Rich La Bonte) with three sisters: Constanza (Margot Breier), Sophie (Sasha Nanus) and Louisa (Sissy Smith).\n\nThis melodramatic plot of rejection, pining and sacrifice may have its basis in reality, but everything else is strictly stylized: back-projected settings, mix-and-match historical costumes, primary-colored walls, actors striking poses and the miming to records of Mozart arias, frequently interrupted by the raw audio track of real, untrained singing. For Rappaport, the ideological myths we internalize and the soap operas we live have to be exposed and mocked, just as the constructed illusion we call filmic realism has to be relentlessly dismantled.\n\nBoth very much of its time (a cousin to contemporaneous works by Yvonne Rainer) and ahead of its time (anticipating the droll strategies of Hal Hartley), MOZART IN LOVE offers a handy checklist of the many acute, often hilarious games of disenchantment devised by this ever-inventive artist.\n\n\"An irreverent take on Mozart's relations with the three Weber sisters: Louisa, whom he loved, but who didn't love him; Constanza, whom he loved and married; and Sophie, who loved him but whom he didn't love. An anthology of arias from Mozart's operas, in which art comments on life through a cheeky use of back-projection and miming to records.\" --Ian Christie, British Film Institute\n\n",

The story begins as Rembrandt has become the portrait painter of choice for Amsterdam's bourgeoisie thanks in part to his well-connected and beautiful young wife Saskia (Kari Matchett). In between his work, Rembrandt becomes caught up in the trials of his young neighbor Samuel (Mitchell Rothpan), who is locked in fierce adolescent rebellion against his father, the respected Rabbi Menasseh Ben Israel (Paul Hecht). Samuel refuses to become a scholar like his father. As a compromise, Rembrandt and the pregnant Saskia propose that Samuel become a studio apprentice while he waits for word from his uncle and a ship to take him to the new world. The arrangement brings an unexpected surprise when Rembrandt learns that the boy's true talent lies in the art of printing. Through his friendship with Rembrandt, Samuel finds his future vocation and the courage to accept his family heritage. Rembrandt benefits also as he rebels against traditional artistic conventions to create a moment in history in \"The Nightwatch.\"\n\nThe film won \"Best Youth Program\" from Today's Librarian.\n\n",

And how much tougher is it if you're just a teenager? We normally associate memory loss with older people, but around the UK scores of teenagers are battling with severe amnesia. This film follows a number of young amnesiacs in their day-to-day lives and for the first time, reveals the huge challenges they face; from school and sports, to shopping and relationships, showing how things most people take for granted are a heartbreaking struggle for these young people.\n\n",

He plays football with his mates and lives with his dad and brother, but everything is grey - life has never really been the same since his mum left. However, transformation can happen when you least expect it, and in a local shop a fashion magazine seems to be calling Dennis - can it be that supermodel Kate Moss is really telling him that it's okay for boys to like Vogue? Aided by Lisa, the coolest girl in the school, Dennis creates a whole new persona. But can a boy wear a dress - and how will his headmaster, his dad and his friends react when they find out?\n\n",

Elsewhere, on a visit to the spectacularly opulent Harewood House in Yorkshire, he glimpses how the slave owners' wealth seeped into every corner of Britain.\n\nFinally, amongst the vast slave registers that record all 800,000 men, women and children in British hands at the point of abolition, David counts the tragic human cost of this chapter in history.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "A series of films exploring the idea that we have been colonised by the machines that we have built, seeing everything in the world today through the eyes of computers.\n\nThis episode looks at why we humans find this machine vision so beguiling. The film argues it is because all political dreams of changing the world for the better seem to have failed - so we have retreated into machine-fantasies that say we have no control over our actions because they excuse our failure.\n\nAt the heart of the film is one of the most famous scientists in the world - Bill Hamilton. He argued that human behaviour is really guided by codes buried deep within us. It was later popularised by Richard Dawkins as 'the selfish gene'. It said that individual human beings are really just machines whose only job is to make sure the codes are passed on for eternity.\n\nThe film begins in 2000 in the jungles of the Congo and Rwanda. Hamilton is there to help prove his dark theories. But all around him the Congo is being torn apart by 'Africa's First World War'. The film then interweaves the two stories - the strange roots of Hamilton's theories, and the history of the West's tortured relationship with the Congo over the past 100 years.\n\n",

Experimental fantasies are depicted in such independent productions as MOONLAND (c.1926), LULLABY (1929), and THE BRIDGE (1929-30). Depression era films by socially-conscious filmmakers reshape drama as demonstrated in Josef Berne's brooding BLACK DAWN (1933) and Strand and Hurwitz's biting NATIVE LAND (1937-41): each pictures a raw reality. Parody and satire find their mark in Theodore Huff's LITTLE GEEZER (1932) and Barlow, Hay and LeRoy's EVEN AS YOU AND I (1937). David Bradley's SREDNI VASHTAR BY SAKI (1940-43) boasts an inadvertent post-modern attitude.\n\n12 films by featured directors: Roger Barlow, Lionel Berman, Josef Berne, G.W. \"Billy\" Bitzer, David Bradley, Boris Deutsch, Frontier Films, Mike Gordon, D.W.

Among her many achievements, she was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris. This film is a fictional account of the Boudreau sisters, Martine (Nathalie Vansier) (age 11) and Eliane (Colleen Rennison) (age 6), who innocently set out to catch spies during World War I. While families are fleeing war-torn Paris, the girls find that a mysterious woman's finger tapping and access to high security public buildings makes her a prime suspect. It turns out that the mysterious woman is Madame Curie (Kate Trotter), whose two Nobel prizes have brought her international acclaim, but her comings and goings in and out of Paris have brought suspicion on to her behavior. In addition, the girls' actions make them look like accessories to potential crimes. Madame Curie is, in fact, helping to save lives through her research and everything is cleared to be innocent. Martine and Eliane learn that even though it might cause some people to be suspicious, curiosity is essential to discovering the secrets in science and life.\n\nWinner of the ALA \"Notable Video\" Award.\n\n",

Together they begin to uncover the truth behind this astonishing middle-aged love story. Antony and Cleopatra are no lovesick juveniles; they are mature, heroic - real - political figures. As such they were quite dangerous roles to write, let alone to play.\n\nCattrall watches different Cleopatras, meets Harriet Walter and Vanessa Redgrave (who have also played the role) and joins actors rehearsing the play at the Globe. Cleopatra is one of the greatest and largest of all Shakespeare's female roles, and must have required a boy actor of extraordinary skill. We look at the source Shakespeare used and how closely he copied the language of a Roman historian to describe Cleopatra's beauty; today he might be at risk for plagiarism. But comparing one of the most famous speeches in the play with its source, line by line, reveals the power of Shakespeare's poetry.\n\nThe episode tracks Marc Antony's first appearance in Shakespeare, as a young and powerful figure in Julius Caesar. Richard Johnson and Patrick Stewart discuss playing Cleopatra's now-aging lover in the later play.\n\nThe conflict between the public and private lives of these two historic figures was bound to end in tragedy. They fail to defeat or escape their enemies. As in Romeo and Juliet, both die by their own hands. In the Globe's candlelit indoor theatre - a version of the playhouse where this play was once performed - Cattrall watches the actors play out Cleopatra's last moments.\n\n",

Her early films show a strong performance art influence and her musical background has continued to be present in her work. In Chicken Movie. Cluck! she included reality and elements of everyday life in her work for the first time. In a way, the film pre-empts her meeting with Jean Rouch upon her arrival in France; she made the film after happening on the following idea by Rouch: \"It is more interesting to film reality as evoked by my presence (and the camera) than to pretend to be able to film it as is.\" The idea that there is no objective reality but only POV, motivated Rina to meet Jean Rouch, and some months later, he showed the film at the Cinematheque saying: \"This is a fresh voice; this is the kind of film we should be making today.\" Rina took his comment as carte blanche and subsequently invited Jean Rouch to act in two of her films, An Egg With No Shell and M. M. les locataires (Ladies and Gentlemen, the Boarders), a film about life in the Paris suburb of Noisy-le-Sec. Filmmaker: Rina Sherman\n\n",

Optical Sound Films explores in detail one of his particular and recurrent concerns, the synaesthesic relationship between sound and image manifest in the material of film sound.

    "title": "The Birth of White Australia",
    "language": "Silent",
    "release_year": 1928,
    "synopsis": "An early Australian silent film depicting historical events on the Young district goldfields, then known as Lambing Flat. During the gold rush of 1861, tensions between Australian miners and immigrant Chinese led to rioting, with Chinese miners attacked and driven from the diggings. The film portrays these events as being the genesis - or birth - of the White Australia policy, a significant political issue of the day.\n\nThe film is a narrative jumble, jumping between actuality and drama, and from historical vignettes to obscure folklore. National events like a re-enactment of Captain Cook's landing and actuality footage of the 1927 Parliament House opening ceremony in nearby Canberra, contrast with depictions of the hardships of settlers and the discovery of gold at Lambing Flat. Aboriginals are depicted both as savages - violently attacking settlers - and saviours, rescuing a starving traveller who is brought to live with the tribe.\n\nBacked financially by the townsfolk of Young, NSW, the bulk of the amateur cast were locals. Many of the 'Chinese', depicted as furtive caricatures with pigtails, were played by whites wearing stockings. Despite a short season in Young, the film had no other screenings and failed to recover its costs. The original film print was discovered by Young Historical Society in the early 1960s, stored in the clock tower of Young Town Hall, and later given to NFSA.

Pioneer Australian director Tim Burstall's adaptation casts Colin Friels as mild-mannered English novelist Richard Somers and Judy Davis as his wife Harriet.\n\nThe Somers leave Europe in the early '20s for a new life in Australia. The couple are captivated by the openness and hospitality with which they are received, but they are soon enveloped in a web of political intrigue, adultery and murder as they become involved in battles between the rising trade unions and an underground fascist group led by \"Kangaroo\", the code-name for its charismatic but dangerous leader.\n\nKangaroo was Burstall's finest theatrical film and through its AFI award-winning achievements in performance and period costume design, stands as a testament to a remarkable career.\n\n",

He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for his \"services to theoretical physics.\" At the end of a brilliant career in 1954, Albert Einstein (Paul Soles) was arguably as famous a media figure as he was a scholar and physicist at Princeton University. Through some interesting circumstances, the wild-haired academic meets young Lannie (Lataye Studwood), a twelve year-old African-American girl, whose mother works on the University cooking and cleaning staff. Getting to know Lannie, Albert is reminded of his own early struggles in Switzerland, his quest for intellectual freedom, and his growing concern for the future of democracy in his adopted America. In this historical drama we see her youth and earnestness renew Albert's spirit and in return Albert gives Lannie an incredible gift: an awareness of her potential.\n\nThe film won the \"Award of Excellence\" from the Alliance for Children & Television and \"Best Film\" from the Chicago International Children's Film Festival.\n\n",

    "title": "Cyrano De Bergerac",

    "release_year": 1925,
    "synopsis": "Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac was a triumph from the moment of its premiere on December 28, 1897. It has become the most popular play of the modern French theater, and Cyrano, despite an ugly visage dominated by an enormous nose, has become a world-beloved symbol of generosity, magnanimity of spirit and beauty of soul.\n\nThe wonderful Cyrano of this film, Pierre Magnier, understudied Coquelin in the original stage production. He toured with Coquelin and Sarah Bernhardt in 1900, playing Laertes to her Hamlet. Magnier frequently performed Cyrano following Coquelin's death in 1909 and remained active on stage and in films for another forty years, being best remembered today as the General in Jean Renoir's Rules of the Game (1939).\n\nIn adapting Cyrano de Bergerac to the silent cinema, director Augusto Genina and scenarist Mario Camerini faced the contradictory task of \"opening up\" the play to take advantage of its spectacular 17th-century settings and its possibilities for action; while at the same time retaining as much as possible the beloved poetic language of Rostand's original work. The grandeur of costume, setting and action is captured not only in impressive staging and sensitive performances but also through the filmmakers' bold decision to present almost the entire work in the highly stylized and beautiful PathZ Stencil Color process.\n\nA NOTE ON THIS EDITION: Film preservationist David Shepard copied an original nitrate source print to Eastman color negative frame-by-frame using a 1909 Bell & Howell film printing machine, and Alpha Cine Laboratories in Seattle, Washington used several dozen single frames snipped from this original print to carefully match Mme. Thullier's original colors in a new print which was digitally mastered at 20 frames per second. Mr. Kuenne's music was recorded in Olympia, Washington in 1999. Video mastering and audio post-production were achieved at Lobster Films, Paris, and NTSC video conversion and post-production at Image Post, Chatsworth, CA. We gratefully acknowledge the support of La Sept ARTE in preparation of this edition.\n\n",

Stationed in the fictitious kingdom of Khairpura-Bhandanna, he rescues Davis (whose yacht has also arrived there) from the villainous maharajah (Dick Sutherland) and his army of sword-wielding warriors in the film's frantic climax. Safely back aboard their respective ship and yacht, Harold proposes to his girl using semaphore, and she accepts. Originally intended as a two-reel comedy short, A Sailor-Made Man proved popular in previews in a four-reel rough cut and became Lloyd's unintentional first feature-length film.\n\n",

Soon after his arrival in Australia in 1952 as a migrant from Italy, he began making films at a time when feature film production in Australia was almost non-existent. His films were seldom seen in Australia and they have been virtually unavailable since.\n\nIn Ninety-Nine Percent, Mangiamele's only comedy, Italian widower Joseph Pino and his young son Peter live a chaotic and deeply opposed life. However their relationship begins to heal as they embark on a quest to find Joseph a wife. This film expresses the anguish of the migrant experience.\n\nThe short drama NINETY NINE PER CENT (1963) reveals Mangiamele's keen eye for visual poetry and the strong humanism of his concern for his characters.\n\n",

Despite the Depression, the decade opened on an optimistic note for the industry. The early 1930s produced the first experiments with sound until sound-on-film established its supremacy. Newsreels came into prominence, with keen rivalry between American-owned Fox Movietone and local competitor, Cinesound Review. Cinesound went on to produce a string of feature films - motion pictures that established Ken G Hall as the most prolific director of the 30s. Although it was a decade of struggle for independent filmmakers, this was also the era that saw the emergence of screen-acting talents like Errol Flynn and Peter Finch, when Dad and Dave were brought to the screen and Charles Chauvel made Forty Thousand Horsemen.\n\n",

His film works, often including serial forms and live performance, are characterized by an enduring concern with time and light as the fundamentals of cinema. Optical Sound Films explores in detail one of his particular and recurrent concerns, the synaesthesic relationship between sound and image manifest in the material of film sound. These investigations take Sherwin from physical manipulation of the very material of film through to live performances utilising multiple film projectors, all of which are explicated through drawings, diagrams, video documentation as well the films themselves.\n\nThis publication provides a unique insight into conceptual and practical concerns for artists' working with film as well as a detailed exploration of the processes and technology involved in its production and exhibition.\n\n",

No one explains the odd comings and goings, the big black cars, the men in suits and hats, the overheard snippets of conversation. But that doesn't stop the children from imagining. Lee makes sense of what she can, aided by half-understood scraps of radio news and blurry photographs on the front pages of the newspaper.\n\nOnly many years later did she learn that the strangers were Russian defectors in hiding from the KGB and in fear for their lives. The Safe House is a half-hour animation based on a true story--a young girl's perspective of one of the most talked about moments in Australia's history--the real-life spy drama known as the Petrov Affair. The film effortlessly evokes memories of childhood and a sense of a time passed as award-winning animator Lee Whitmore highlights the fragility of the safe little world she lived in--as innocent of the larger world as Australia itself seemed half a century ago.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "One of the most infamous and daring tales of mutiny at sea, the story of HMS Bounty's fateful voyage as presented by Charles Chauvel (The Rats of Tobruk) in 1933 is one of exotic adventure, treachery, peril and lasting historical significance. Purchased by the Royal Navy and refitted for service, HMS Bounty embarked on an expedition to acquire breadfruit plants from the Tahiti region. With Commanding Lieutenant William Bligh (Mayne Lynton) at the helm and a hardworking crew ready to serve, the ship set sail and arrived in Tahiti after ten arduous months at sea. After collecting more than a thousand breadfruit plants and enjoying a taste of fraternisation with the natives, the return journey was less than jovial. Marked with growing frustration and tension between the crew, mutiny soon erupted and the rest became the stuff of legend. In his first ever film performance, screen legend Errol Flynn (Captain Blood) portrays infamous mutineer and man of action, Fletcher Christian. In The Wake of The Bounty is a detailed dramatised account of the mutiny aboard HMS Bounty on 28th of April, 1789. Fully restored and presented in a brand new transfer, In The Wake of The Bounty incorporates documentary footage, anthropological observations and insightful narration from Arthur Greenaway, helping to make Charles Chauvel's first 'talkie' an exotic exploration into the consequences of this famed historical incident.\n\n",

Britain's Jihadi Brides reveals how Islamic extremism has become a sprawling and uncontrollable force via the internet.

    "synopsis": "\"Woman like she refuses to divulge the name of him who wronged her.\"\n\nThis 1918 Australian feature is one of the most significant surviving treasures of a silent film heritage which is now largely extinct. Comprising three interconnecting storylines, it finally resolves into a dramatic saga of love, honour, betrayal, seduction and revenge.\n\nThe story takes the concept of primitive justice - an eye for an eye - and extends it to 'a sister for a sister'. Ralph Manton discovers that his sister Marjory has been seduced and demands to be told the name of the man. Faithful to her lover, she refuses but later Ralph discovers his identity and confronts him. The tables are turned...\n\nThe film was a critical and commercial success and offered audiences more than just a sensational melodrama. It questioned the social mores of the day and the double standards of morality in regard to the men as the seducers.\n\nThis restoration by the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia uses still photographs and additional intertitles to replace the missing early scenes from the film and ensure continuity of story. Due to the archival nature of the original nitrate film, some deteriorated sections affect the picture quality. The colour tints are from the original source film print.\n\n",

    "title": "Once Were Monks Series",

    "synopsis": "Melbourne is home to a fascinating, eccentric, erudite and warring tribe of men. They are pious and bawdy, gregarious and solitary, indulgent and ascetic, radical and conservative, young and old. They are the men of the Blessed Sacrament Order at the St Francis Monastery in the heart of Melbourne. Their lives are turned upside down when they are forced to move to a pub during renovations.\n\nMany of the fathers and brothers are facing old age. They can no longer climb the stairs and it is hoped that new en-suite bathrooms will ease the problem. While most of the men relocate to the pub across the road, Father Ken Boland decides to stay on-site in a workers shed. Others seek alternative accommodation: historian Father Donald Cave moves to his old house in inner-city Melbourne, Father Gonzalo Munoz takes a job as live-in caretaker of a meditation centre, and Brother Gerard Develin must part with his pet budgie for the period of construction.\n\nThe renovation acts as a catalyst, prompting the men to question their faith and commitment to the Catholic church. A number are even unsure whether they will return to the monastery once refurbishment is complete.\n\nThroughout the upheaval, church life goes on. Mass is still said and confessions are heard. A young member of the order, Brother Boris Perlaki, is ordained and a funeral is held for Brother Bernard Scanlan, who dies on his 102nd birthday.\n\nThe series follows Father Donald to Rome where he delivers his latest book on the order's founder, and to Istanbul where he fulfils his life-long dream to visit Aya Sofya, once one of the greatest churches in Christendom. Back in Melbourne, Brother Gerard makes regular trips to the outskirts of the city to visit his budgie, now boarding with a friend.\n\nOnce Were Monks is the story of what happens when this tight-knit community is thrown into the outside world. It is about the problems of faith in the modern era, the forces of change and the pressures of tradition. Ultimately it is about a group of men who share in religious life with all its joys and sorrows.\n\n",

The United Nations estimates almost 200,000 people have been killed since Syria's civil war began, with many hundreds of thousands more injured. Millions have been forced from their homes, but the full human cost of the conflict is little known to the outside world because of the danger Western journalists face in trying to enter areas not controlled by the government. Most doctors have fled from those locations and many hospitals have been destroyed. The documentary follows British trauma surgeon David Nott as he makes the perilous journey across the border into Syria to work alongside medics who have stayed behind and shows him carrying out life-saving surgery in a facility forced underground by daily bombardment.\n\n",

The collection features the Academy Award winning Leisure plus The Magic Arts, Megalomedia and The Movers.\n\nLeisure (made in 1976, duration 14 mins) takes a wry look at the world of work and leisure through history. It considers our changing patterns of work since the Industrial Revolution and the effects mechanisation and electricity have had on our leisure time.\n\nThe Magic Arts (1978, 19 mins) is a visual onslaught of artistic ideas, showing how art relates to and intertwines with our daily lives.\n\nMegalomedia (1981, 28 mins) is a humorous and searching examination of the development of media and its audience. Master of ceremonies, Max Gillies guides us through a rapid succession of thoughts and perceptions in three parts--the Media Machine, the Media Market and the Media Mind.\n\nThe Movers (1987, 49 mins) provides an historical perspective of the development of technology from the primitive age through to the nuclear age. It examines the human being's 'search for the good time'.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "In a London psychiatric hospital, an enigmatic young man claims, among other things, to be the son of an exiled African dictator - a story that becomes unnervingly plausible. In a fiery and suspenseful debate, his doctor and consultant clash over the patient's diagnosis and treatment. What ensues is an incendiary tale of race, madness and a Darwinian power struggle at the heart of a dying NHS. Filmed on location in London, this dynamic and often very funny adaptation of Joe Penhall's award-winning play retains the music, lighting and sound team from the original stage production, which premiered in April 2000. Blue/Orange is based on Joe Penhall's award winning play of the same name.\n\n",

    "title": "The Childhood of Maxim Gorky",
    "language": "Russian, Silent",
    "release_year": 1938,
    "synopsis": "An immortality that Soviet Russia has heretofore allotted only to Lenin and Marx is bestowed upon the country's greatest writer, Maxim Gorky.\n\nOne of the noblest achievements of pre-war Soviet cinema,O (Jay Leyda, Kino), this haunting, unforgettable film is based upon Maxim Gorky's 1913 autobiography My Childhood and shows a twelve-year-old's journey in life against the tumultuous backdrop of 19th century Russia. With tableaux beautifully vivid and forceful, it recounts the touching relationships which develop when Gorky is put into his grandparents' custody. His grandmother, the consummate incarnation of good and truth, is a simple woman who knows how to make people laugh. She presents the genuine beauty of optimism in the direst situations, of honesty in a world of deceit, of unselfishness and total sacrifice around treachery and hatred, of fighting spirit in defense of values and dignity. His multi-faceted grandfather, who can be fiercely brutal and childishly tender, senile one moment and wise the next, etches another indelible memory.\n\nGorky's poverty-stricken childhood formed his life-long compassion for the underdog, and the film is filled with powerful portraits of lower-class people whose qualities of integrity and dignity shine through their hopeless circumstances. Among many others are the half-blind Grigori who works at the grandfather's dye factory and who is taunted by his co-workers before finally succumbing to total blindness to become a down-and-out beggar, and Gorky's little orphaned friends, who live out of garbage cans dreaming of a Utopian Neverland. From these portraits come an inspiring, panoramic view of human conditions and conflicts.\n\nThis edition is restored from a fine grain master and includes the original 1938 soundtrack by Lev Schwartz, as well as new English subtitles. Presented at the end of the main feature is the bonus short newsreel, Moscow Clad in Snow, which shows scenes of the pre-Revolutionary city during winter. It was shot in 1908 and directed by Joseph-Louis Mundwiller, who would later go on to be one of the cinematographers on Abel Gance's Napoleon.\n\n",

    "title": "Taming of the Shrew - with Morgan FreemanShakespeare Uncovered",
    "language": "English",
    "release_year": 2014,
    "synopsis": "Freeman first discovered Shakespeare in school in Mississippi. He went on to play the hero of this play - Petruchio - in The Public Theater's Shakespeare in the Park production in New York, set in the Wild West. Freeman notes this play has set the template for all of the battle-of-the-sexes comedies that have followed; many a romantic comedy has The Taming of the Shrew running through its veins.\n\nIt's a love story between two unlikely characters. The Shrew is Katherine, a woman who is bitter, viperish, wild - or simply not prepared to accept the conventions of her time - and thus \"unmarriageable.\" Petruchio is after a wife, and the wealthier the better. We see some Petruchios who took on the \"taming\" - including Richard Burton, John Cleese and Raul Julia - and such famous Kates as Elizabeth Taylor, Fiona Shaw, Sinead Cusack and Meryl Streep. Freeman reunites with his own Kate, Tracey Ullman. Julia Stiles, star of the 1999 teen comedy adaptation, 10 Things I Hate About You, reflects on this contemporary version. And the Royal Shakespeare Company takes a version of the play to a school near where Shakespeare grew up, where viewers observe what children make of this very adult piece.\n\nFor many, this play is uncomfortable to watch. It was one of Shakespeare's very first plays and may seem too brutal for modern audiences. It ends with a speech about how women should obey their men. But is this the sexist propaganda that it first appears - or is there something more complicated (and interesting) going on? Freeman concludes that beneath the apparent cruelty is a message about equality in relationships. And we hear observations from many women who also admire the play, including pioneering feminist Germaine Greer (who appears as an expert commentator in several episodes).\n\n",

    "synopsis": "VACANT POSSESSION is the story of two families - one white, one Aboriginal - both living in the shadow of the past. A past fragmented by events too long unresolved. Weaving dream, memory, fantasy, present and past, VACANT POSSESSION is a story of conflict and the complexities of reconciliation.\n\nTessa (Pamela Rabe) feels the pull to return to her childhood house in the wake of her mother's death. Like Nash's recent acclaimed essay film The Silences (2015) this is a work that explores the gaps caused by conflicting self images, between the need to preserve the shell of a shared, traumatic past and the desire, through 'progress', to expunge it. The messy idea of home, and everything unspoken and unresolved attached to it, is at the centre of a film that sits at an important cross roads in Nash's career. The title \"refers not only to the 'vacant possession' of a house but also to Australia itself\" (David Stratton).'\n\n",

For at least 30,000 years, humans have represented the naked form in a variety of ways. From the ideal to the real, the Romantic to the Surrealist, there have been almost no end of works devoted to the unclothed human body. This series - presented by writer and broadcaster Tim Marlow - will examine those artworks, the societies that produced them and the artists that made them.\n\nIn this episode, The Nude - The Enlightenment, Tim Marlow looks at how the image of a naked bosy was used for a variety of purposes during the period - to shock, to coerce, to titillate, to impress and to instruct. Examples are Rembrandt's 'The Anatomy Lesson', Ingres' 'The Turkish Bath' and Rodin's 'The Age of Bronze'.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "This film is a 'hybrid' blend of music, documentary and drama. The story is set in the 1920s in outback Australia, and evokes a time when it was illegal for white Australians and Aboriginal people to marry. It was not uncommon for a drover and his Aboriginal wife to pass off their relationship under the guise of her being 'a drover's boy'. In subterfuge, she had to bind her breasts, cut her hair and change her name to disguise herself as an Aboriginal boy.\n\nThis is one such story, sensitively told, based on a ballad by Australian bush legend and singer-songwriter, Ted Egan. The song, and the film, pay tribute to this form of forbidden union and the significant contribution that Aboriginal women made to the pastoral history of frontier Australia.\n\nThe filmmaker, Margaret McHugh, is both a documentary director and a video artist whose work has been honoured at numerous festivals and in exhibitions around Australia and internationally. After studying visual art, photography and filmmaking in Australia, Spain and Scotland, Margaret enrolled at the Australian Film Television and Radio School in Sydney and later returned to AFTRS to make The Drover's Boy. The film had its world premiere at the 2015 Sydney Film Festival.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Almost two billion children have been born since the turn of the millennium. They are the first generation of the 21st century. This extraordinary film sets out to ask what kind of a world these millennium children are about to inherit.\n\nFrom the Bafta-winning team behind Welcome to Lagos and Exit Through the Gift Shop, this unique documentary takes us into the lives of kids in every corner of the world, from street kids in war-torn Congo to the hidden world of children working on a Cambodian dump, from the poorest part of the USA through to life as a teenager in the world's most dangerous city. We hear their hopes, their dreams and their ideas on what would make their world a better place.\n\nIn 2000, 180 world leaders agreed on a series of ambitious targets to improve the lives of people everywhere. The Millennium Development Goals they signed up to were meant to herald unprecedented progress in every corner of Earth. They promised enormous reductions in poverty, increased life expectancy and an altogether fairer world.\n\nThose goals are being renewed this year. This powerful and poignant film asks kids to show us, from their perspectives, whether older generations have lived up the promises we made back at the turn of the millennium.\n\n",

Displaying almost Quixotic ambition, Mangiamele's first venture into production was a feature film, IL CONTRATTO (1953), which he began within a year of arriving in Australia.\n\nThis drama about the isolation and alienation of Italian migrants was never completed, but what remains is a remarkably powerful portrait of a neglected segment of Australian society.\n\nPlease note that this video also contains the program extras, which begin at timecode 1:31:30.\n\n",

His film works, often including serial forms and live performance, are characterized by an enduring concern with time and light as the fundamentals of cinema. Optical Sound Films explores in detail one of his particular and recurrent concerns, the synaesthesic relationship between sound and image manifest in the material of film sound. These investigations take Sherwin from physical manipulation of the very material of film through to live performances utilising multiple film projectors, all of which are explicated through drawings, diagrams, video documentation as well the films themselves.\n\nThis publication provides a unique insight into conceptual and practical concerns for artists' working with film as well as a detailed exploration of the processes and technology involved in its production and exhibition.\n\n",

For the first time a specific method of montage had been used in this film, which came to be known later as \"Soviet montage\".\n\nDespite the fact that Kuleshov's films had preceded many discoveries of Vertov and Eisenstein, his works are little known outside Russia. Among his students were Vsevolod Pudovkin and Boris Barnet. In the introduction to Kuleshov's book The Art of Cinema (1928), his former students wrote: \"It was on his shoulders that we crossed into the open sea. We make films - Kuleshov made cinematography...\"\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Thirty years after the end of the Vietnam War, some families still searching for loved ones missing in action are turning to psychics for help. Millions died in the Vietnam War and 400,000 of them have never been found. But some families of the missing have found new hope in the form of a group of psychics. Accepted, if not approved of, by the government, these psychics believe they can talk to the dead. In 1996, they set up a centre devoted to the research of psychic phenomena.\n\nOne man who works at the research centre is 37-year-old Nguyen Phac Bay and is said to have found over 500 bodies last year. The film also follows one female psychic through minefields and jungles in search of the dead. Nam Ngia, an ex-army nurse, works alone and has devoted her life to the task of finding those who went missing during the war. Apparently, when she is said to be speaking to the lost spirits, they pass on details that shock the living relatives - details they swear no one else could know. It may seem unlikely, but in Vietnam and much of South East Asia many believe that contact with dead ancestors is normal - that the dead can connect to the living.This film raises the question of what is belief and what is hope when so many are mourning the missing from the Vietnam War.\n\n",

Then \"the cinema\" studies Gerald (from numerous angles) followed by a standoff as filmmaker and subject circle one another, dueling with cameras to determine who's watcher and who's watched.\n\nGerald's philosophical soundtrack musings (\"People don't ask for beauty, they'll settle for less ugliness,\" \"To live together destroys integrity\") suggest a preference for the abstract over the intimate that's borne out when our protagonist finds a romantic interest (Teresa O'Connor). Yet in this chaptered black-and-white meditation on art and life, it's possible \"true love\" (should it exist outside the movies) might win out for the first and possibly the last time in this unique American independent oeuvre.\n\n\"A portrait film of a gawkily handsome man--contrasted with Garbo in the first shot, completely excised by the end, his spirit lingering in the melancholy that remains. The first Rappaport movie I've seen. Kind of like meeting someone who you hit it off with, but you feel somewhat cautious about because you're not quite sure why the rapport is working. Perhaps it's the price of being confronted with a wholly unique perspective--you're shaken so completely to the core that distrust bubbles up. Who is this person who's doing something in none of the ways I'm used to?\" --Keith Uhlich\n\n",

Lloyd plays Harold \"Speedy\" Swift, a baseball-crazy young man who cannot hold a job. His employment misadventures include work as a soda jerk and a cab driver. Harold's girlfriend, Jane (Ann Christy), lives with her grandfather, \"Pop\" Dillon (Bert Woodruff), who owns New York City's last horse-drawn streetcar. A gang hired by a railroad monopoly steals the horse and streetcar. By stopping Pop's streetcar from operating more than twenty-four hours, the rail monopoly hopes to steal away his franchise. Speedy ultimately finds the car and manages to get it back on track in time to make the daily run, saving Pop's franchise. Filmed partly on location in New York, the film features a memorable cameo from baseball legend Babe Ruth and a wild chase scene in downtown Manhattan, where Harold must hurtle the horse-drawn streetcar pell-mell through chaotic city traffic.\n\nNominated, Best Director, Comedy - Academy Awards 1929\n\n",

When his idle club friends abduct him on his wedding day (believing they are preventing him from making a foolish mistake), Harold (with his inebriated groomsmen in tow) must race back to the mission so as not to miss his own wedding. The race-to-the-rescue sequence that climaxes For Heaven's Sake on the double-decker open-top bus is one of Lloyd's most memorable sequences.\n\n",

The stories unfold through observational sequences and interviews with the main players at critical points in the drama.\n\nWhat motivates the real estate agents in matching buyers and sellers?

For them, there's more than bricks and mortar at stake--it's their dreams, their memories and the single biggest investment of their lives.\n\nUnder the Hammer is there with them at the dinner table, at the open house, at the meeting with the agent and of course just prior to, during, and after the auction.\n\nThis is a series which captures not only intimate emotional moments but the displays of bravado, happiness, shock and disappointment as the hammer goes down.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Optical Sound Films collects the ongoing work and research of Guy Sherwin, one of the pre-eminent British film artists of the last 40 years in a unique artist's films. Guy Sherwin studied painting at Chelsea School of Art in the 1960s before becoming closely associated with the British avant garde film movement centred on The London Film-makers Co-operative in the 1970s. His film works, often including serial forms and live performance, are characterized by an enduring concern with time and light as the fundamentals of cinema. Optical Sound Films explores in detail one of his particular and recurrent concerns, the synaesthesic relationship between sound and image manifest in the material of film sound. These investigations take Sherwin from physical manipulation of the very material of film through to live performances utilising multiple film projectors, all of which are explicated through drawings, diagrams, video documentation as well the films themselves.\n\nThis publication provides a unique insight into conceptual and practical concerns for artists' working with film as well as a detailed exploration of the processes and technology involved in its production and exhibition.\n\n",

With specially adapted cameras attached to their goggles, volunteers from Medecins Sans Frontieres - Doctors Without Borders' (MSF) working in the high risk zone of an Ebola Case Management Centre in Sierra Leone give viewers a very real sense of what it's like on the frontline. Their pain and despair is all too clear when they have to separate parents from a sick child and then when that child loses their fight for life. But even in these desperately difficult circumstances there are moments of euphoria as patients who have been cured leave the centre. Exclusive footage also reveals the medical staff's frustrations at the lack of support from the international community and pharmaceutical companies in fighting the Ebola virus, which has been responsible for more than 5,000 deaths since the outbreak began.\n\n",

    "release_year": 1962,
    "synopsis": "Giorgio Mangiamele is one of the most under-estimated figures in Australian cinema history. Soon after his arrival in Australia in 1952 as a migrant from Italy, he began making films at a time when feature film production in Australia was almost non-existent. His films were seldom seen in Australia and they have been virtually unavailable since.\n\nThe Spag [Released] and The Spag [unreleased]\n\nA portrait of growing up as a newly arrived migrant in 1950s Melbourne, revolving around Giovannino, a young Italian paperboy. When his father dies, his mother wants to return to Italy, but Giovannino wants to stay, despite always being the 'dago' and 'spag'.\n\nThis film expresses the anguish of the migrant experience. The short drama THE SPAG (c.1960-2) reveals Mangiamele's keen eye for visual poetry and the strong humanism of his concern for his characters.\n\nThe unreleased version has an adult as its central character, experiencing anti-Italian prejudice and hatred in the back streets of Carlton. When it was suggested that he upgrade the film, Mangiamele re-wrote and re-filmed it with a child in the leading role. Some story elements are the same, and the theme of ethnic prejudice is the same, but the two \"versions\" are essentially different films.\n\nPlease note that the soundtrack of the Unreleased version is not complete and is at times technically crude. As with all of Mangiamele's films, the soundtracks were post-synched, and he did not record sound on location.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Detailing the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, I, Caesar takes a fascinating look at the public and private lives of six key men who ruled ancient Rome: Julius Caesar, Augustus, Nero, Hadrian, Constantine and Justinian. Their careers were made up of bloody battles and tactical bribery, stunning innovation and profound corruption, dazzling rhetoric and vicious back-stabbing - and together they form a picture of the most sophisticated highs and most brutal lows of the Roman Empire's inception, heyday and decline. Stretching at its peak, from the north of England to southern Egypt and from the west coast of Spain to Syria in the east, the Roman Empire included within its boundaries myriad people, cultures and climates. The task of ruling it seems an impossible one, even with today's communication technology. So how was it achieved two thousand years ago? And why has ancient Rome had such profound influence on western civilization ever since?\n\nWhether your interest is Caesar's brilliant military manoeuvring, Rome's astonishing statuary and architecture or the political strategies behind imperial power, these films offer an accessible introduction to the subject. \"An elegantly made and intelligently composed programme\" - Daily Telegraph Using unequalled location footage, previously unseen images and careful re-enactments, and the expertise of the world's finest scholars, this series brings to life the world of ancient Rome. I, Caesar takes a fresh look at the Roman Empire and shows that ancient history doesn't have to be a thing of the past...\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Rudolph Valentino's first independent production, Cobra, was released less than a year prior to the actor's untimely death at age 31. It is an unusual and contradictory showcase for the actor who is remembered more than any other as the icon of irresistible sexuality in Hollywood silent film.\n\nBeleaguered by women in his native land, a promiscuous Italian Count, Rodrigo Torriani (Valentino) escapes to New York to work for an elegant antiques dealer specializing in Italian objets d'art. The ambitious young man cannot suppress the Don Giovanni within himself and he is soon embroiled in a new series of romantic entanglements with secretaries, husband hunters and extortionists. But when his best friend's new wife captures suave Torriani in her cobra-like gaze, he reforms just in time to avoid disgrace and even death-by-fire.\n\nCobra truly represents the visual richness of silent cinema at its peak. At the center of it all is Valentino, charming and photogenically resplendent. Even with his stunning looks, Valentino's appeal as the Great Lover, enacted according to conventions of the 1920s, is often difficult for modern audiences to fathom. By contrast, his far more restrained performance in Cobra makes this film more accessible today than the great hits upon which the star's reputation was built.\n\n",

    "title": "Bed and Sofa (And Chess Fever)",

    "synopsis": "Daring for its time - or any time - Bed And Sofa is the story of a love triangle between a woman and two men living together in a one-room basement apartment in 1927 Moscow. When Liuda becomes pregnant and no one knows which man is the father, she must determine her own future. With an involving plot, comic invention, pathos, naturalistic performances, and highly-charged use of space and objects, director Abram Room illuminates the lives of the characters but without offering a simplistic resolution. Instead he successfully uses their personal stories to probe complex issues of lingering patriarchy and female self-sufficiency in the new society. A sparkling print and excellent new music contribute fresh life and added meaning to an amazingly modern Russian film classic.\n\nThe delightful comedy Chess Fever by Vsevolod Pudovkin and Nikolai Shpikovsky is included as a half-hour film bonus. It's a witty and ingenious satire on the chess craze which swept Moscow at the time of the International Tournament there.\n\nThis edition of Bed And Sofa is digitally mastered at the visually correct speed from an excellent original print brought to the USA in the 1930s by film historian Jay Leyda. For the first time the film is presented with correct and full English intertitles.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Each year, millions of tourists come to Australia looking for the quintessential \"Aussie experience\", but are they getting anything more than koalas, boomerangs and a shrimp on the barbie? This four-part series takes an eye-opening journey behind the scenes of Australia's multi-billion dollar tourism industry.\n\nSelling Australia reveals a world of ruthless marketing where canny entrepreneurs are determined to give visitors exactly what they want, whether it's a taste of Aboriginal culture, sandy beaches or a bush adventure. It's the Australia they've come to expect overseas and a picture that has been carefully and expensively constructed through international advertising campaigns and local initiatives. But how does it fit with reality and the image the nation has of itself? And is it evolving as the country changes?\n\nThis entertaining, often amusing series offers a ride around the Golden Triangle of Australian tourism, from Sydney at the height of its Olympic frenzy to the Reef in tropical Queensland, and then to the country's red heart. It moves at a cracking pace from shearing sheds and indigenous dancing to snorkelling and Japanese weddings, with plenty of photo opportunities on the way. As expected, the scenery is stunning and experiences memorable. But at the centre of each episode are important questions about Australia and the nation's identity.\n\nWith tourism fast becoming one of the biggest industries across the globe, Selling Australia looks at just how far a country is prepared to go in search of the tourist dollar.\n\n",

These are familiar scenes of bills, endless washing, weekend sports, the frenetic noise of games, the strange quiet of sleep.\n\nDave leaves for work at six in the morning, before the rest of the family is awake. Sally is a full-time, hands-on mum, who assists in her children's classrooms. \"I thought you had kids and whilst they played, you read books and got your photos in order,\" she laughs.\n\nSally is the patient one, the disciplinarian. Dave, in many ways, is a big kid himself - joining the afternoon backyard footy games with glee. He admits he's made some selfish decisions in the past. Despite the family's reluctance to move from Newcastle, Dave accepted a job in Sydney from which he was later made redundant. He's now got a new, more junior position which will help meet the mortgage payments on their Concord home.\n\nIt's hard sometimes for Dave and Sally to balance their different attitudes and approaches, and even harder to find time for themselves among the constant whirlwind of children and activities. But as we listen to these two often-exhausted parents talk about their young family, their postponed renovations, their frustrations and dreams, we see how communication, respect and humour are really the essence of successful family life.\n\n",

She met her Greek husband when she was 23 and had two children before she discovered from police that he was a bigamist. Although she divorced him, her daughters Julie and Simone say the family has never said a bad word about their father, who has since died.\n\nThe girls have a clutch of loving relatives and another inspiring role model in Helen's gutsy mum, who brought up seven children almost single-handedly and is still helping them out.\n\nBut this is not a stereotypical Lebanese-Greek household. Helen has supported the family by working most nights in a pub. She has always been open with her girls, giving them freedom and encouraging them to make the most of their education and opportunities. At 17 and 22, Julie and Simone are strong, beautiful and intelligent. Opinionated and lively, these three women are always talking - about work, money, music, boys - and they love a party.\n\nNow, the family is at a turning point. Julie has just finished high school and is wondering about university. Simone, who edits her own hip-hop magazine, is looking for her first full-time job. And Helen is about to turn 50 and has promised to give up smoking. She lost her job a few weeks ago after the pub changed hands. The new owners want her back as a manager but Helen is not so sure.\n\nDespite this uncertain future, the family is strong. They know they have each other.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "In the final episode of his travels through Brazil, Michael Palin finds many surprises as he encounters the rich diversity of the more European and Asian cultures that have created a new melting pot in the deep south of Brazil.\n\nIn the picture-perfect town of Parati, set amidst the Mata Atlantica, he meets up with Prince Joao de Braganza, heir to the defunct throne of Brazil. The prince argues that the arrival of the Portuguese court in Brazil, who escaped from Napoleon's occupation, did much to establish the institutions that have enabled Brazil's economy to flourish.\n\nMichael joins Carolina Ferraz, star of a galaxy of telenovellas, the immensely popular Brazilian soap operas, on the backlot of her most recent TV success, where issues of poverty fuel the storylines alongside the racier love triangles.\n\nWhilst taking to the skies of Sao Paolo to avoid the hundred-mile traffic jams with mega-rich king of waste disposal Wilson Quintela, Michael learns that there are millions to be made from garbage.\n\nTravelling south to Blumenau and Pomerode, Michael finds German speakers - including model Priscilla Falaster, who dreams of becoming the next Giselle Bundchen - and tries his hand pulling steins from a mobile bierkeller. Bavarian schulplatte dancers and chance encounters with spiritualists including Marcello Paes Leme challenge his views on what makes a typical Brazilian.\n\nLeaving the beauty and serenity of the Pantanal, Michael comes to his journey's end at the magnificent Iguazu falls, where he concludes that Brazil has much to offer the world as it takes its place as a new superpower.\n\n",

    "language": "English, Portuguese",
    "release_year": 2012,
    "synopsis": "In the third part of his Brazilian odyssey, Michael Palin visits the source of Brazil's great mineral wealth and then travels to one of the world's greatest cities to see how this new-found wealth is being spent, changing the lives of millions of its inhabitants.\n\nMichael starts this leg of the journey in the mineral-rich state of Minas Gerais - General Mines. He visits an old gold mine once owned by the British, before going to see a vast opencast iron ore mine that is such a feature of the Minas landscape. Iron ore deposits that are fuelling Brazil's economic miracle but there is always an environmental price to pay, and Michael meets some ordinary Brazilians who are dedicated to preserving the natural beauty of the state.\n\nAfter Minas it's down to Rio de Janeiro, host to the next Olympics and World Cup. Rio has always had a reputation as a party town but also has suffered from terrible violence, with heavily armed drug gangs controlling the notorious shanty towns or favelas that make up a large part of the city. Now, the authorities have decided to spend some of Brazil's new money on healing the rift between the favelas and the rest of the city. The policy of 'pacification' aims to drive the drug gangs out and fund new infrastructure and social programmes to make the favelas truly part of the city. Michael visits what used to be some of the most violent places on Earth to see how lives have been transformed by pacification.\n\nMichael's time in Rio isn't all about what is happening in the favelas. He also finds time to visit some of Rio's best-known locations, learns how to celebrate a goal like a Brazilian radio commentator, and books a room in one of the city's infamous 'love hotels'!\n\n",

It is a period synonymous with progress. But at the same time, a group of men and women seemingly spurned the modern age, turning to the medieval past as a source of inspiration.\n\nFrom Horace Walpole to John Ruskin to Bram Stoker, The Shock of the Old is the tale of how an old, derided style of architecture became a defining characteristic of the Victorian age and was as important as the Romantic and Modernist movements that it bridged.\n\nDiscover how the gothic style went from vulgar to the height of fashion; how it first symbolised tradition before becoming the hallmark of industrial progress; and how it gave voice to the savage horrors of the time.\n\n",

Religious rituals remain embedded in the major events of our lives. In this thought-provoking series, evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins asks what happens if we leave religion behind. He explores what reason and science might offer to inspire and guide our lives in religion's place. Can science bring understanding in the face of death, help us tell right from wrong or reveal the point of life in the first place? In a journey that takes him through visually stunning locations across the world, Richard Dawkins builds a powerful argument for facing up to the scientific truth about life and death - however hard that might be.\n\n",

The country has more billionaires per head than any other country on earth, it is also the most unequal nation in Europe. In this two-part series, told through rigorous investigation, interviews with key participants and fascinating archive footage, Jacques Peretti investigates the seemingly irresistible rise of the super-rich and examines how the super-rich are upending the lives and certainties of everyone else. From an obscure legal loophole making Britain one of the most attractive tax havens in the world to the deliberate wooing of the super-rich by the government to reconfigure the British economy, Jacques considers how the advent of the super-rich has had far-reaching effects on every aspect of Britons' lives.\n\n",

Forty percent of the country's financial budget - PS16.5 billion in today's money - was used to compensate the former slave owners. Exploring this extraordinary step taken by the British government, this series uses meticulously detailed records of the compensation to reveal the sheer scale of slavery across all social classes. At the same time, it also examines the political storm that surrounded abolition and emancipation - the 25 years of bitter argument that eventually led to compensation. The mass injection of cash that followed fundamentally changed British society - financially, politically, commercially, and culturally. Forgotten Slave Owners offers a fascinating, in-depth look at a key moment in British - a time of great change that continues to be felt today.\n\n",

An orphan who lives at the local Seminary for Young Ladies, Rosa senses the intensity of his feelings and both fears and loathes her teacher.\n\nJasper also knows he can never declare how he feels because Rosa will soon be married to his orphan nephew Edwin Drood. At night, under the influence of opium, Jasper dreams of murdering Edwin so Rosa can be his.\n\nThe arrival of Helena and Neville Landless, orphan twins from Ceylon, marks a turning point in all of their lives. Smitten by Rosa and instantly disliking Edwin, the hottempered Neville struggles to hide his feelings and the pair quarrel.\n\nIn a drug-fuelled moment, Jasper sees an opportunity to make his dreams reality. He can murder Edwin, blame Neville and claim Rosa for himself. The next morning Edwin is missing and Neville is under suspicion. Did Jasper go through with his plan?\n\n\"This was beyond grand\" -- Observer\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Adapted by award-winning writer Andrew Davies from Alan Hollinghurst's Booker Prizewinning novel, this three-part drama serial is set during the hedonistic 1980s and stars a mix of young talent and established names.\n\nThis is a story of love, class, sex and money, crawling deep under the skin of 1980s Britain. Framed by the two general elections of the decade, which returned Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative government to power, The Line Of Beauty spans four extraordinary years of tragedy and change.\n\nNick Guest, a young, gay Oxford graduate of modest means, is invited to stay with the wealthy Fedden family at their home in west London. Dysfunction and glamour come in equal measure with the Feddens, headed by father Gerald, a Tory MP and an empty man, who is consumed by his rising status within the party, wife Rachel who barely recognises her manic-depressive daughter Catherine, and son Toby, for whom Nick has had a secret crush ever since their time together at Oxford.\n\nDuring his stay with the Feddens, Nick experiences every extreme of the boom time eighties, from falling head-over-heels in love for the first time, to drug-induced highs and lows, via waltzing with the Prime Minister. Amidst the euphoria of the champagne and parties, the young graduate witnesses political scandal, the deception and hypocrisy of the rich and the desperate tragedy of the outbreak of AIDS.\n\nThis outsider's journey into the heart of the beautiful and seductive world of the social elite bristles with emotion, drama and social commentary. Full of style and wit, this is a richly textured coming-ofage story, set against the backdrop of a ruthless decade.\n\n",

She catches a glimpse of a handsome stranger, but he ignores her.\n\nLater Tess is driven by family poverty to claim kinship with the wealthy D'Urbervilles and seek a portion of their family fortune. Here she meets a very different man - the manipulative and fraudulent Alec. Will her very innocence prove to be her downfall?\n\nOne year later a changed Tess watches the May dances. Embarking on a new chapter in her life, she leaves her home, finding work as a dairy maid. Here Tess meets the stranger from the celebrations - Angel Clare. He seems to offer her love and salvation, but Tess must choose whether to reveal her past or remain silent...\n\nA thrilling story of seduction, murder, cruelty and betrayal unfolds. Whilst unstintingly gorgeous and romantic, this new adaptation is an intense, moving and provocative depiction of the tragically beautiful story.\n\n\"[Gemma Arterton is] fabulous as Tess: passionate, moody, enigmatic, naive, strong, determined, earthy.

    "synopsis": "From acclaimed writer Andrew Davies comes this enchanting adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel about love and marriage.\n\nLeft penniless after their father's death, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood face an uncertain future. They need to marry well if they are to retain their comfortable existence.\n\nWith a number of possible suitors - the intelligent and charming Mr Edward Ferrars, the handsome Mr John Willoughby and the more thoughtful and compassionate Colonel Brandon - they seem to have their share of options. But is there more to these men than first impressions suggest? What is the history between Willoughby and Brandon? And what secret is Ferrars hiding?\n\nThe story follows the sisters' very different approaches to love and marriage. Romantic and impulsive, Marianne falls in love deeply, but will not heed her sister's warning that her behaviour will leave her open to gossip and innuendo. Sensitive to social convention, her sister Elinor tries to conceal her own romantic disappointment, even from those closest to her. The sisters must learn that sense should mix with sensibility if they are to find personal happiness in a society where status and money govern the rules of love.\n\nAndrew Davies has proven himself to be the master of literary adaptation, from classics, such as Bleak House, to the politics and drug-fuelled sex and hedonism of the 1980s in The Line of Beauty. An excellent script combined with an outstanding cast means that Austen fans will be waiting in anticipation for this adaptation.\n\n\"Andrew Davies's superb new adaptation of Jane Austen's novel is so watchable, above and beyond the usual classic adaptations. What makes it exceptional, I think, is the immense warmth between the characters - particularly the mother and her daughters - that compels the viewer to care deeply what becomes of them all.\" The Times\n\n",

His unmarried mother dies only moments later, leaving Oliver alone in the world.\n\nTen years on and after growing up in a workhouse overseen by the awful Mr Bumble, watching the suffering and cruelty endured by the children, Oliver finally decides he wants more.

    "synopsis": "Flora Thompson's charming love letter to a vanished corner of rural England is brought to life in this warm-hearted adaptation.\n\nSet in the Oxfordshire countryside in the 1880s, Lark Rise to Candleford depicts the last bright flickering of a now-vanished way of life, as Victorian England reaches into the 20th Century.\n\nRich, funny and emotional, this series follows the relationship of two contrasting communities: Lark Rise, the small hamlet gently holding on to the past, and Candleford, the small market town bustling into the future.\n\nSeen through the eyes of young Laura, their inhabitants endure many upheavals and struggles as the inexorably change comes; their stories by turns poignant, spirited and uplifting.\n\nAnd Laura herself must face great change. Taking a job in Post Office in Candleford, run by the mercurial Dorcas, she turns her back on her childhood hamlet to make her way in the world. With her loyalties divided, she must choose her own path to womanhood...\n\nWhile Laura's relationship with Dorcas is the show's emotional heart, Lark Rise to Candleford draws on a rich ensemble cast for a strong serial element, pointing up the little conflicts, romances and misunderstandings between the tiny Lark Rise and the more worldly Candleford. Laura feels these tensions through her own very private tug of love, as Dorcas and Laura's family back home seem to pull her in different directions.\n\n\"Beautifully observed and splendidly acted ... There are comic cameos by Liz Smith and Dawn French, but it is Olivia Hallinan's assured performance as Laura that stands out.\" -- Guardian\n\n",

    "synopsis": "A young man sets his own tragic downfall in motion with one simple but horrifying act\n\nSet in St Petersburg in the second half of the 19th Century, this is Dostoevsky's disturbing tale of Raskolnikov, a highly intelligent, strikingly handsome and thoroughly conceited young student who, full of misplaced theory and pathologically stirred by the cruelty and injustice he sees around him, decides to test his courage and integrity by killing a miserable old pawnbroker - whom he is sure nobody will miss.\n\nRaskolnikov's crime goes seriously awry, and a wily investigator sets up a complex series of traps, encounters and conversations, playing with Raskolnikov's intelligence and arrogance. Slowly, Raskolnikov incriminates himself - and eventually confesses.\n\nDostoevsky's Crime and Punishment is the king of detective stories, the king of murder stories and the king of psychological thrillers. But, as an undoubted masterpiece of world literature, it goes far beyond the mere mechanics of its extraordinary plot to take on the tragic force of myth.\n\nRaskolnikov is the quintessential antihero - a Hamlet of his time. He is one of the sexiest characters in literature because, despite being a murderer, he is young, impassioned, lonely and lost.\n\nThis modern version of Crime and Punishment, with its sexy young cast, is a philosophical but deeply engaging portrait of a man who seals his fate by committing a single dire act of murder. Raskolnikov attempts to escape the implications of his crime, but he is left tormented and alienated from society in this classic moral tale by one of Russia's most celebrated novelists.\n\n\"Grim, paranoiac and involving throughout.\" -- Guardian\n\n\"...tremendously effective at conveying both the mood and moral import of the novel.This is serious television, the kind that the BBC is best at ... All the cast deserve praise, but the drama is made by Simm and Ian McDiarmid's Porfiry\" -- The Times\n\n",

    "synopsis": "Acclaimed writer Andrew Davies turns his talents to one of Charles Dicken's most brilliant novels - arguably the greatest ever depiction of Victorian London, from its glittering heights to its very lowest depths - adapting it into a series of half-hour episodes.\n\nAn all-star cast come together to bring this classic Dickens' novel to life. At the court of Chancery, the interminable suit of Jarndyce and Jarndyce becomes the centre of a web of relationships at all levels of society and a metaphor for the decay and corruption at the heart of Victorian England.\n\nAn epic feast of characters and storylines, Bleak House is a passionate indictment of the legal system that is as searingly relevant today as it was in the mid-19th Century. At its heart is the story of the icily beautiful Lady Dedlock, who nurses a dark secret, and the merciless lawyer Tulkinghorn, who seeks to uncover it. The generous John Jarndyce, struggling with his own past, and his two attractive young wards Richard and Ada, are all caught up, like Lady Dedlock, in the infamous case of Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce, which will make one of them rich beyond imagination if it can ever be brought to a conclusion. Esther Summerson, is a girl without a past, whom Jarndyce takes under his wing as a companion for Ada, but with whom he falls in love, and whose connection with Lady Dedlock may bring ruin to them both.\n\nThe cast of supporting characters contains some of Dickens' most famous creations - Smallweed, the evil moneylender; Krook, the first (and possibly last) man in literature to die by spontaneous combustion; Guppy, the ambitious young clerk, infatuated with Esther; Bucket the ice-cool police inspector, at the centre of fiction's first ever whodunit; and Little Jo, the young crossing sweeper, whose tragic death almost brought Victorian England to a standstill.\n\n",

    "synopsis": "A victim of her father's debts, 'Little Dorrit' has spent her childhood behind the heavy, iron doors of the Marshalsea Prison in London. Will a chance meeting change her future?\n\nThis gripping new series by Andrew Davies brings to life Dickens's powerful story of struggle and hardship in 1820s London. When Arthur Clennam returns to England after many years abroad, his curiosity is piqued by the presence in his mother's house of a young seamstress, Amy Dorrit.\n\nThe cold and forbidding Mrs Clennam isn't usually given to charity, so why has she made an exception in taking on Amy? Is she making reparations for a past wrongdoing? Arthur's quest to discover the truth takes him to the Marshalsea Prison for Debt. Here he meets and befriends Amy's father, William Dorrit, the prison's longest serving inmate. As he tries to help the Dorrits, Arthur discovers that the dark shadow of debt stretches far beyond the walls of the Marshalsea Prison, to affect the lives of many. Just as it is possible to climb to the very top in London Society's intricate game of snakes and ladders, so it is possible to slip right down.\n\nBut if the daring and adventurous Arthur succeeds in unravelling the mystery of his family's past, where will it leave him in the scheme of things? And where will it leave the Dorrits?\n\n\"Little Dorrit...is turning into one of the most compelling TV productions of the year\" -- Daily Mail\n\n\"The BBC does these costume dramas so well ITV doesn't even attempt them...They're what the BBC does best\" -- Daily Mirror\n\n",

    "synopsis": "In the early 1980s, documentary filmmaker Stephen Schaller was instrumental in the rediscovery and restoration of The Lumberjack (1914), the oldest surviving film made in Wisconsin, and produced by a group of itinerant filmmakers who traveled from town to town making \"local talent\" pictures. Schaller's lovely and sometimes deeply emotional, 63-minute journal/essay film offers a look at the making of the Wausau, Wisconsin classic, including interviews with the one surviving cast member and the relatives of others who appeared in the movie. His investigation includes moving remembrances of the people and town of Wausau as it was, and even reveals the on-set accidental death of one of The Lumberjack's top cameramen. More than just a piece of local history, When You Wore a Tulip is also of interest to anyone who cares about film history and preservation. Discovering Schaller's gentle, artful movie is just as exciting as finding a lost family album.\n\nPresented by Flicker Alley, in partnership with Blackhawk Films(r) and Cardoza Pictures.\n\n",

The series postulates an innovative and often controversial view of experimental cinema as a product of avant-garde artists, of Hollywood directors, and of amateur movie-makers working collectively and as individuals at all levels of film production during the last decade of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century.\n\nAnthology Film Archives and Deutsches Filmmuseum working in collaboration with 60 of the world's leading film archive collections including British Film Institute, George Eastman House, Library of Congress, and Museum of Modern Art, among many others, prepared preservation and restorations masters of the rare art films. Many of the films have not been available since their creation over a century ago, some have never been screened in public, and almost all have been unavailable in pristine projection prints until now. The films have been seen at museums, archives, universities, and theaters around the world. Over 500 venues have featured the UNSEEN CINEMA, making it one of the largest and perhaps the most viewed film retrospectives in history.\n\nCurated by Bruce Posner and produced by David Shepard\n\nMade possible in part by Cineric, Inc., Eastman Kodak Company, Film Preservation Associates\n\n\"I have been obsessed in the last couple of weeks with 'Unseen Cinema,' which is astounding.

    "synopsis": "In the great Australian tradition of All the Rivers Run, based on Max Fatchen's novels The River Kings and Conquest of the River, this four-part miniseries captures the perilous life along South Australia's Murray River and the many adventures aboard the paddleboat steamer Lazy Jane during the 1920s.\n\nWith his father absent and life on the land an interminable struggle, sixteen year-old Shawn Hofner (Tamblyn Lord) is forced to leave behind farm life and find work to support his family. The one sure thing that offers up hope is the Murray River and Shawn takes up a job as a deck-hand on a reliable steamboat run by well-seasoned Captain Elijah (Bill Kerr, Gallipoli).\n\nIt is a tough existence for a naive boy on the rapid flowing river, with danger and discovery around every bend. During Shawn's many trips up and down the river he is destined to experience first-hand the tough and unforgiving temperament of nature, navigating life's great adventure and the many tragedies and triumphs that come floating his way.\n\nNominated for Most Popular Actor in a Miniseries/Telemovie (Tamblyn Lord) at the Logie Awards.\n\n",
