    "synopsis": "Animal rights activists free a group of infected chimpanzees to horrifying results in this speculative sci-fi horror effort from Trainspotting director Danny Boyle. Waking from a coma in a deserted London hospital 28 days later, bicycle courier Jim (Cillian Murphy) takes to the deserted city streets in a state of mystified confusion. Joining forces with another group of survivors following a terrifying encounter in a seemingly abandoned church, Jim soon learns the truth behind the deserted streets and the menacing creatures that lurk in the shadows. It's soon revealed that the chimpanzees had been harboring a deadly virus that sends its victims into a furious, murderous rage, and in the days following the initial exposure, the entire population was nearly wiped out due to the resulting homicidal rampage. Is there still a glimmer of hope for humanity -- or has the deadly \"rage\" virus found its way to foreign shores and infected the entire planet?",

    "synopsis": "From director David Cronenberg (A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE, DEAD RINGERS, THE FLY, EASTERN PROMISES) and based on the prophetic novel by Don DeLillo, comes COSMOPOLIS, a contemporary thriller that turns into a wild, hypnotic odyssey through our new millennium's obsessions with power, money, control, information, technology, violence, sex, mortality, revolution, destruction and ultimately, redemption. Unfolding in a single cataclysmic day, the story follows Eric Packer (Robert Pattinson) a 28-year old financial whiz kid and billionaire asset manager as he heads out in his tricked-out stretch limo to get a haircut from his father's old barber, while remotely wagering his company's massive fortune on a bet against the Chinese Yuan. Packer's luxe trip across the city quickly becomes dizzyingly hellish as he encounters explosive city riots, a parade of provocative visitors, and is thrust into a myriad of intimate encounters. Having started the day with everything, believing he is the future, Packer's perfectly ordered, doubt-free world is about to implode. Produced by Paulo Branco and Martin Katz, COSMOPOLIS also stars Juliette Binoche, Sarah Gadon, Mathieu Amalric, Jay Baruchel, Kevin Durand, K'Naan, Emily Hampshire with Samantha Morton and Paul Giamatti.",

    "synopsis": "One of Marvel Comics' most popular characters comes to the screen for the first time in this sci-fi action-thriller. Matthew Murdock (Ben Affleck) is a lawyer whose father, a prizefighter, was killed by gangsters when Murdock was just a boy. Since then, Murdock has devoted his life to bringing wrongdoers to justice and is willing to help others by taking on cases no other attorney will touch. Murdock is also blind, after being struck down by a truck while trying to save a man from being hit. What no one knows is that Murdock was also doused with an unusual radioactive isotope which had a strange effect on him -- while Murdock's sight may be gone, his other senses have been raised to such a keen pitch that they act like radar, allowing him to tell where he's going and what happens around him, both near and far away. Murdock puts his gifts to use at night as the costumed crime-fighter Daredevil, whose pursuit of justice has earned him the wrath of underworld leader Kingpin (Michael Clarke Duncan). Kingpin wants Daredevil out of his way once and for all, and hires Bullseye (Colin Farrell), a super-assassin with an uncanny ability to throw blades, to do the job. Daredevil also makes the acquaintance of Elektra Natchios (Jennifer Garner), a woman with super-heroic talents who is also on Kingpin's bad side, though it remains to be seen if she has aligned herself with the forces of good as Daredevil has done. Jon Favreau, Joe Pantoliano, and David Keith highlight Daredevil's supporting cast.",

In exchange for the (stolen) lyrics to Nick Chapel's last record, all of which is about Elektra, Cora needs Elektra to seduce her fiancée. Elektra reluctantly agrees to do this favor, setting in motion a series of hilarious events which will see her come face to face with detectives, sex bloggers, emotionally unstable neighbors and the Virgin Mary herself as she wrestles with the prospect of motherhood and tries to become a person of substance.",

The 54th Regiment of Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry was made up of black soldiers-some Northern freemen, some escaped slaves-and led by whites, including Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick), the son of Boston abolitionists. The unit faced virulent racism, not only from their Southern adversaries but from Northern whites who resisted arming black soldiers and doubted their ability to fight effectively. But in the bloody attack on Fort Wagner in Charleston, South Carolina, the members of the 54th distinguished themselves in an almost suicidal battle. Their heroic actions helped throw open the gates of the Union Army to 180,000 blacks who risked their lives for emancipation and citizenship, and may have helped turn the tide of the war.</p>",

His retirement is interrupted, however, when a bizarre wealthy couple, the Mayflowers (Richard E. Grant and Sandra Bernhard), threaten to kill his best friend Tommy (Danny Aiello) unless he agrees to steal three objects created by Leonardo Da Vinci. Hawk doesn't know these objects' significance beyond their historical value, nor does he know what to make of the beautiful and mysterious Anna Baragli (Andie MacDowell), an undercover nun who may be working for the CIA, the Vatican, or the Mayflowers. Ultimately it is up to Hudson Hawk to put an end to the Mayflowers' nefarious scheme, keep Tommy out of danger, enjoy a little time with Anna, and maybe even save the world.",

    "synopsis": "From the minds of Fred Wolf and David Spade (Joe Dirt and Joe Dirt 2: Beautiful Loser) comes a comic romp about family, pride and porta-potty races. On July 4th weekend, Saltstone Park brims with families eager to relax. At campsite 16, however, the Jones, Jones and Jonas families find that their campsite has been overbooked. What starts as a simple clerical error quickly spirals into a family feud fueled by the rivalry of three equally stubborn leaders: Jose (Juan Gabriel Pareja, Goliath, The Walking Dead), an affable but slovenly slacker; Franklin (Finesse Mitchell, Roadies, Brothers in Atlanta), a rising politician with a disdain for the outdoors; and Charlie (Charlie Sheen, Two and a Half Men, Anger Management), a goofy, alcoholic hairdresser. By way of porta-potty races and sexually-charged forest encounters, these determined families wage a ferocious war for the right to holiday fun. When Jose’s sister, Felipa (Naya Rivera, Glee, Devious Maids), and Franklin both admit that the trip was all a ploy, the plot thickens. Also starring Leah Remini (The King of Queens, The Talk), Charlotte McKinney (Joe Dirt 2: Beautiful Loser), Chris Mulkey (Whiplash, CSI: Cyber) Clint Howard (Arrested Development, Key & Peele), Chanel Iman (Dope), Barry Shabaka Henley (Brothers in Atlanta, Better Call Saul), LilRel Howery (The Carmichael Show), Tiffany Haddish (The Carmichael Show), Efren Ramirez (Eastbound and Down, Napoleon Dynamite), Naomi Kyle (IGN Daily Fix, Batkid Begins) and Danny Mora (Chop Shop, McFarland, USA).",

When he picks up $20 million in cash, his double-crossing partner blasts two security men and holds his gun to Banks' head, ordering him to drive. After one of the most extraordinary chase scenes ever filmed on the streets of Las Vegas, Banks gets away with the money, but eventually lands in prison. Now his former \"partners\" want the money and will do anything to get it. But with the assistance of newfound friend Ice Cool (Anthony \"Treach\" Criss), he escapes to claim what's his and unleash an explosive vengeance. Proving that the fist is mightier than the gun, Banks doesn't give up until he makes off with both a sympathetic FBI agent and the money.",

When a series of murders occurs among Pendleton&#39;s faculty and student body, Natalie (Alicia Witt), a young, bright student, begins to notice a bizarre link between the killings. Recognizing that all of the deaths have a resemblance to one urban legend or another, Natalie investigates Pendleton&#39;s own 30-year-old legend about a series of murders at the hand of an abnormal psych professor. She then discovers a twisted plan to create the ultimate urban legend and her lifeless body is the centerpiece.</p>",

The demons are on the move, and as a member of the Black Guard, Taki's job--his *real* job--is to protect the human world from the demon world. And his work is just beginning! A fragile peace exists between the two worlds, brokered by a treaty. In order for the renewal of that treaty to go smoothly, Taki has to protect Giuseppi Mayart, a two hundred year old man with immense spiritual power, from an extremist faction of demons seeking to bring chaos to the two worlds. Worst of all, Taki's assigned a partner for the mission: the unnaturally beautiful Makie, a fellow Black Guard member... and herself a demon! The two will have to go all out to protect the old man, as not only are the demons going to extreme lengths to kill him, but Mayart seems oddly unconcerned for his own safety. Is there more going on than Taki and Makie realize?",
